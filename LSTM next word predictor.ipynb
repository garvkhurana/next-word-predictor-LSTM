A single man of large fortune;\\r\\n      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow so? how can it affect them?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied his wife, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow can you be so\\r\\n      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\\r\\n      them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that his design in settling here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDesign! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\\r\\n      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\r\\n      must visit him as soon as he comes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\\r\\n      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\\r\\n      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you\\r\\n      the best of the party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\\r\\n      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\r\\n      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\\r\\n      thinking of her own beauty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\\r\\n      comes into the neighbourhood.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\\r\\n      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\\r\\n      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\\r\\n      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\\r\\n      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\\r\\n      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\r\\n      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\r\\n      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\\r\\n      little Lizzy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\\r\\n      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\r\\n      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\r\\n      giving _her_ the preference.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey have none of them much to recommend them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied he;\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\r\\n      something more of quickness than her sisters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\\r\\n      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor\\r\\n      nerves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\\r\\n      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\\r\\n      consideration these twenty years at least.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, you do not know what I suffer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\\r\\n      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\\r\\n      will not visit them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\\r\\n      visit them all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\r\\n      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\\r\\n      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\\r\\n      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\\r\\n      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\\r\\n      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\\r\\n      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\\r\\n      solace was visiting and news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\r\\n      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\r\\n      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\\r\\n      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\\r\\n      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\\r\\n      with,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her\\r\\n      mother resentfully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csince we are not to visit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you forget, mamma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat we shall meet him\\r\\n      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\\r\\n      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\r\\n      have no opinion of her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo more have I,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I am glad to find that\\r\\n      you do not depend on her serving you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\\r\\n      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake! Have a little\\r\\n      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her father; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe\\r\\n      times them ill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not cough for my own amusement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Kitty fretfully.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo-morrow fortnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, so it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand Mrs. Long does not come\\r\\n      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to\\r\\n      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\r\\n      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\r\\n      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acquaintance is\\r\\n      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\\r\\n      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\\r\\n      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\\r\\n      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\\r\\n      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsense, nonsense!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that\\r\\n      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you\\r\\n      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep\\r\\n      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet us return\\r\\n      to Mr. Bingley.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so\\r\\n      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not\\r\\n      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\r\\n      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first\\r\\n      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\r\\n      had expected all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\r\\n      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\r\\n      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\r\\n      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and\\r\\n      never said a word about it till now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\n      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\r\\n      raptures of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat an excellent father you have, girls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, when the\\r\\n      door was shut. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know how you will ever make him amends\\r\\n      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of\\r\\n      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\r\\n      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\r\\n      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare\\r\\n      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lydia stoutly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\r\\n      youngest, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the tallest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\r\\n      would return Mr. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit, and determining when they should\\r\\n      ask him to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n\\r\\n      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\r\\n      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\r\\n      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\r\\n      They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,\\r\\n      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\r\\n      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the\\r\\n      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\\r\\n      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\\r\\n      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\r\\n      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\\r\\n      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\\r\\n      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\\r\\n      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart were entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\r\\n      Netherfield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand all the\\r\\n      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit, and sat\\r\\n      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\\r\\n      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\\r\\n      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\\r\\n      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\\r\\n      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and\\r\\n      rode a black horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\r\\n      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\r\\n      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\\r\\n      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\\r\\n      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their\\r\\n      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\\r\\n      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his\\r\\n      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be\\r\\n      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\\r\\n      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\\r\\n      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\\r\\n      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with\\r\\n      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of\\r\\n      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,\\r\\n      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from\\r\\n      London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered\\r\\n      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another\\r\\n      young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\r\\n      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine\\r\\n      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.\\r\\n      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\\r\\n      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\\r\\n      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general\\r\\n      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\\r\\n      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\\r\\n      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\\r\\n      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\\r\\n      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to\\r\\n      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\\r\\n      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\r\\n      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\\r\\n      compared with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\r\\n      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\r\\n      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and\\r\\n      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\\r\\n      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him\\r\\n      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and\\r\\n      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\\r\\n      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the\\r\\n      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His\\r\\n      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\r\\n      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\\r\\n      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\\r\\n      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\\r\\n      daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\\r\\n      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a\\r\\n      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance\\r\\n      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome, Darcy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must have you dance. I hate to see you\\r\\n      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much\\r\\n      better dance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\r\\n      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as\\r\\n      this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and\\r\\n      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\r\\n      punishment to me to stand up with.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would not be so fastidious as you are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bingley,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant\\r\\n      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of\\r\\n      them you see uncommonly pretty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there\\r\\n      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very\\r\\n      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner\\r\\n      to introduce you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich do you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and turning round, he looked for a moment at\\r\\n      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly\\r\\n      said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I\\r\\n      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies\\r\\n      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your\\r\\n      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with\\r\\n      me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\r\\n      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She\\r\\n      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for\\r\\n      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\\r\\n      anything ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\\r\\n      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she\\r\\n      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified\\r\\n      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned\\r\\n      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\\r\\n      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough\\r\\n      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet\\r\\n      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\r\\n      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which\\r\\n      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still\\r\\n      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\\r\\n      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\\r\\n      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had\\r\\n      rather hoped that all his wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views on the stranger would be\\r\\n      disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story\\r\\n      to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, my dear Mr. Bennet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as she entered the room, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe have had a\\r\\n      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had\\r\\n      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\r\\n      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her\\r\\n      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,\\r\\n      my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only\\r\\n      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,\\r\\n      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;\\r\\n      but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,\\r\\n      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\r\\n      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,\\r\\n      and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with\\r\\n      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth\\r\\n      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\\r\\n      _Boulanger_\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he had had any compassion for _me_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her husband\\r\\n      impatiently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che would not have danced half so much! For God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his\\r\\n      ankle in the first dance!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\\r\\n      handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life\\r\\n      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace\\r\\n      upon Mrs. Hurst\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gown\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\r\\n      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another\\r\\n      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of\\r\\n      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I can assure you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Lizzy does not lose much\\r\\n      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid\\r\\n      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that\\r\\n      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,\\r\\n      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance\\r\\n      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one\\r\\n      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\r\\n      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\r\\n      sister how very much she admired him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is just what a young man ought to be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csensible,\\r\\n      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!\\xe2\\x80\\x94so\\r\\n      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is also handsome,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich a young man\\r\\n      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\\r\\n      thereby complete.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\r\\n      time. I did not expect such a compliment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference\\r\\n      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_\\r\\n      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He\\r\\n      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as\\r\\n      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for\\r\\n      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave\\r\\n      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Lizzy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\r\\n      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good\\r\\n      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a\\r\\n      human being in my life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always\\r\\n      speak what I think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With\\r\\n      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\r\\n      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;\\xe2\\x80\\x94one\\r\\n      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or\\r\\n      design\\xe2\\x80\\x94to take the good of everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character and make it\\r\\n      still better, and say nothing of the bad\\xe2\\x80\\x94belongs to you alone.\\r\\n      And so, you like this man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sisters, too, do you? Their manners\\r\\n      are not equal to his.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when\\r\\n      you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,\\r\\n      and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a\\r\\n      very charming neighbour in her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\r\\n      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\r\\n      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\r\\n      of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by\\r\\n      any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\r\\n      them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\r\\n      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of\\r\\n      being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\\r\\n      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first\\r\\n      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\r\\n      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and\\r\\n      of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every\\r\\n      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of\\r\\n      others. They were of a respectable family in the north of\\r\\n      England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories\\r\\n      than that their brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fortune and their own had been acquired\\r\\n      by trade.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\r\\n      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\\r\\n      estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it\\r\\n      likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was\\r\\n      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was\\r\\n      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his\\r\\n      temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at\\r\\n      Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\n      His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own;\\r\\n      but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\r\\n      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.\\r\\n      Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\r\\n      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by\\r\\n      an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did\\r\\n      look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the\\r\\n      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner\\r\\n      said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\r\\n      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to\\r\\n      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\r\\n      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\r\\n      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the\\r\\n      strength of Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\r\\n      of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was\\r\\n      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was\\r\\n      clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\r\\n      fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.\\r\\n      In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was\\r\\n      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\r\\n      giving offence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\r\\n      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with\\r\\n      pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\r\\n      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\r\\n      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as\\r\\n      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\r\\n      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\r\\n      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\r\\n      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either\\r\\n      attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\r\\n      but she smiled too much.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so\\xe2\\x80\\x94but still they\\r\\n      admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,\\r\\n      and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet\\r\\n      was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt\\r\\n      authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n\\r\\n      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the\\r\\n      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been\\r\\n      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable\\r\\n      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to\\r\\n      the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been\\r\\n      felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business\\r\\n      and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting\\r\\n      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile\\r\\n      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\\r\\n      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled\\r\\n      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the\\r\\n      world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\\r\\n      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.\\r\\n      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation\\r\\n      at St. James\\xe2\\x80\\x99s had made him courteous.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\r\\n      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The\\r\\n      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about\\r\\n      twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intimate friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk\\r\\n      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the\\r\\n      assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\r\\n      communicate.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet with\\r\\n      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ were Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first\\r\\n      choice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; but he seemed to like his second better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.\\r\\n      To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her\\xe2\\x80\\x94indeed I rather\\r\\n      believe he _did_\\xe2\\x80\\x94I heard something about it\\xe2\\x80\\x94but I hardly know\\r\\n      what\\xe2\\x80\\x94something about Mr. Robinson.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;\\r\\n      did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asking him how he\\r\\n      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there\\r\\n      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he\\r\\n      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last\\r\\n      question\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt, there\\r\\n      cannot be two opinions on that point.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word! Well, that was very decided indeed\\xe2\\x80\\x94that does seem\\r\\n      as if\\xe2\\x80\\x94but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      said Charlotte. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as\\r\\n      his friend, is he?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Poor Eliza!\\xe2\\x80\\x94to be only just _tolerable_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head to be vexed by his\\r\\n      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would\\r\\n      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last\\r\\n      night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once\\r\\n      opening his lips.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you quite sure, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am?\\xe2\\x80\\x94is not there a little mistake?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Jane. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye\\xe2\\x80\\x94because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and\\r\\n      he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very\\r\\n      angry at being spoke to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bingley told me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat he never speaks much\\r\\n      unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is\\r\\n      remarkably agreeable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\r\\n      agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how\\r\\n      it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare\\r\\n      say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,\\r\\n      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Lucas,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I wish he had danced with Eliza.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnother time, Lizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would not dance with\\r\\n      _him_, if I were you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with\\r\\n      him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis pride,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Lucas, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes not offend _me_ so much as\\r\\n      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot\\r\\n      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\r\\n      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I\\r\\n      may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is very true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I could easily\\r\\n      forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPride,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of\\r\\n      her reflections, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis a very common failing, I believe. By all\\r\\n      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\r\\n      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\r\\n      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\r\\n      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\r\\n      imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\r\\n      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without\\r\\n      being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,\\r\\n      vanity to what we would have others think of us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried a young Lucas, who came\\r\\n      with his sisters, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should not care how proud I was. I would\\r\\n      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\r\\n      your bottle directly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\r\\n      that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n\\r\\n      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The\\r\\n      visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pleasing\\r\\n      manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and\\r\\n      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger\\r\\n      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted\\r\\n      with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this\\r\\n      attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth\\r\\n      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,\\r\\n      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though\\r\\n      their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\r\\n      all probability from the influence of their brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s admiration.\\r\\n      It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire\\r\\n      her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to\\r\\n      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the\\r\\n      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she\\r\\n      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered\\r\\n      by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength\\r\\n      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of\\r\\n      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the\\r\\n      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may perhaps be pleasant,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Charlotte, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto be able to\\r\\n      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\r\\n      disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her\\r\\n      affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\r\\n      the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\r\\n      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so\\r\\n      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it\\r\\n      is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\r\\n      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\r\\n      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.\\r\\n      In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection\\r\\n      than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may\\r\\n      never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If\\r\\n      _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton\\r\\n      indeed not to discover it too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRemember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disposition as you\\r\\n      do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\r\\n      conceal it, he must find it out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley\\r\\n      and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours\\r\\n      together; and as they always see each other in large mixed\\r\\n      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in\\r\\n      conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every\\r\\n      half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is\\r\\n      secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as\\r\\n      much as she chooses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour plan is a good one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhere nothing is\\r\\n      in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were\\r\\n      determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\r\\n      should adopt it. But these are not Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings; she is not\\r\\n      acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\r\\n      degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known\\r\\n      him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;\\r\\n      she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined\\r\\n      in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make\\r\\n      her understand his character.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she\\r\\n      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\r\\n      you must remember that four evenings have been also spent\\r\\n      together\\xe2\\x80\\x94and four evenings may do a great deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\r\\n      they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to\\r\\n      any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has\\r\\n      been unfolded.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Charlotte, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish Jane success with all my heart;\\r\\n      and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had\\r\\n      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his\\r\\n      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a\\r\\n      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so\\r\\n      well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does\\r\\n      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to\\r\\n      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of\\r\\n      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the\\r\\n      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it\\r\\n      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attentions to her sister,\\r\\n      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\r\\n      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\r\\n      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\r\\n      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it\\r\\n      clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good\\r\\n      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\r\\n      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark\\r\\n      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\\r\\n      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure\\r\\n      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her\\r\\n      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting\\r\\n      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was\\r\\n      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly\\r\\n      unaware;\\xe2\\x80\\x94to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable\\r\\n      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance\\r\\n      with.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\r\\n      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\r\\n      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William\\r\\n      Lucas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, where a large party were assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat does Mr. Darcy mean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she to Charlotte, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby listening\\r\\n      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\r\\n      see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do\\r\\n      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid\\r\\n      of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming\\r\\n      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend\\r\\n      to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking\\r\\n      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\\r\\n      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a\\r\\n      ball at Meryton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\\r\\n      energetic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are severe on us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Lucas. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\n      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!\\xe2\\x80\\x94always\\r\\n      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my\\r\\n      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;\\r\\n      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who\\r\\n      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d On\\r\\n      Miss Lucas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s persevering, however, she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well; if it\\r\\n      must be so, it must.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\r\\n      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar\\r\\n      with\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x98Keep your breath to cool your porridge,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I shall keep\\r\\n      mine to swell my song.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a\\r\\n      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of\\r\\n      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at\\r\\n      the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of\\r\\n      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge\\r\\n      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\r\\n      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\r\\n      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\r\\n      excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\r\\n      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing\\r\\n      half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad\\r\\n      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the\\r\\n      request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases,\\r\\n      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end\\r\\n      of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\r\\n      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\r\\n      was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir\\r\\n      William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\\r\\n      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of\\r\\n      the first refinements of polished societies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\r\\n      amongst the less polished societies of the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Every savage\\r\\n      can dance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Sir William only smiled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour friend performs delightfully,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\n      continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I\\r\\n      doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\r\\n      sight. Do you often dance at St. James\\xe2\\x80\\x99s?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid\\r\\n      it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have a house in town, I conclude?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself\\xe2\\x80\\x94for I am\\r\\n      fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that\\r\\n      the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\r\\n      disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\r\\n      towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very\\r\\n      gallant thing, and called out to her,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must\\r\\n      allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable\\r\\n      partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much\\r\\n      beauty is before you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And, taking her hand, he would have given\\r\\n      it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not\\r\\n      unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said\\r\\n      with some discomposure to Sir William,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I\\r\\n      entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg\\r\\n      for a partner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\\r\\n      honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor\\r\\n      did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\\r\\n      persuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\\r\\n      deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\\r\\n      dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am\\r\\n      sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is all politeness,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is, indeed\\xe2\\x80\\x94but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\\r\\n      Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object\\r\\n      to such a partner?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\\r\\n      injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with\\r\\n      some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can guess the subject of your reverie.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should imagine not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\\r\\n      evenings in this manner\\xe2\\x80\\x94in such society; and indeed I am quite of\\r\\n      your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet\\r\\n      the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all\\r\\n      these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\\r\\n      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great\\r\\n      pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman\\r\\n      can bestow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired\\r\\n      he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\\r\\n      reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Elizabeth Bennet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Elizabeth Bennet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Miss Bingley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am all\\r\\n      astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?\\xe2\\x80\\x94and pray\\r\\n      when am I to wish you joy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A\\r\\n      lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\\r\\n      love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be\\r\\n      wishing me joy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\\r\\n      absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,\\r\\n      indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with\\r\\n      you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\\r\\n      entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\\r\\n      her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\\r\\n      two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\\r\\n      entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and\\r\\n      their mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,\\r\\n      could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been\\r\\n      an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\\r\\n      to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\\r\\n      settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\\r\\n      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\\r\\n      tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\\r\\n      their aunt and to a milliner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shop just over the way. The two\\r\\n      youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\\r\\n      frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\\r\\n      their sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99, and when nothing better offered, a walk to\\r\\n      Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish\\r\\n      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the\\r\\n      country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\\r\\n      from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\\r\\n      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia\\r\\n      regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,\\r\\n      and Meryton was the headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most\\r\\n      interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their\\r\\n      knowledge of the officers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 names and connections. Their lodgings\\r\\n      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the\\r\\n      officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this\\r\\n      opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They\\r\\n      could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s large\\r\\n      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was\\r\\n      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an\\r\\n      ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet coolly observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\\r\\n      be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it\\r\\n      some time, but I am now convinced.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with\\r\\n      perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\\r\\n      Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\\r\\n      day, as he was going the next morning to London.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am astonished, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you should be\\r\\n      so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think\\r\\n      slightingly of anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s children, it should not be of my own,\\r\\n      however.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of\\r\\n      it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x94but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\\r\\n      agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\\r\\n      particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\\r\\n      youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the\\r\\n      sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I\\r\\n      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\r\\n      I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well\\xe2\\x80\\x94and,\\r\\n      indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,\\r\\n      with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I\\r\\n      shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked\\r\\n      very becoming the other night at Sir William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in his\\r\\n      regimentals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMamma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Lydia, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and\\r\\n      Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as they did\\r\\n      when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\\r\\n      Clarke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s library.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman\\r\\n      with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the\\r\\n      servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes sparkled with\\r\\n      pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter\\r\\n      read,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?\\r\\n      Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is from Miss Bingley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMY DEAR FRIEND,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa\\r\\n      and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest\\r\\n      of our lives, for a whole day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s _t\\xc3\\xaate-\\xc3\\xa0-t\\xc3\\xaate_ between two women\\r\\n      can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the\\r\\n      receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with\\r\\n      the officers.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Yours ever,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCAROLINE BINGLEY\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith the officers!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Lydia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder my aunt did not tell\\r\\n      us of _that_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDining out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is very unlucky.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan I have the carriage?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\\r\\n      likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat would be a good scheme,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you were sure\\r\\n      that they would not offer to send her home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chaise to go to\\r\\n      Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had much rather go in the coach.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\r\\n      They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if you have got them to-day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      purpose will be answered.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the\\r\\n      horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on\\r\\n      horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\\r\\n      cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane\\r\\n      had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were\\r\\n      uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued\\r\\n      the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not\\r\\n      come back.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, more\\r\\n      than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.\\r\\n      Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the\\r\\n      felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a\\r\\n      servant from Netherfield brought the following note for\\r\\n      Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMY DEAREST LIZZY,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to\\r\\n      be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends\\r\\n      will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also\\r\\n      on my seeing Mr. Jones\\xe2\\x80\\x94therefore do not be alarmed if you should\\r\\n      hear of his having been to me\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, excepting a sore throat and\\r\\n      headache, there is not much the matter with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Yours, &c.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\\r\\n      note aloud, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\\r\\n      illness\\xe2\\x80\\x94if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\\r\\n      was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\\r\\n      trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she\\r\\n      stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I\\r\\n      could have the carriage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\r\\n      though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\r\\n      horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her\\r\\n      resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can you be so silly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas to think of such\\r\\n      a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when\\r\\n      you get there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be very fit to see Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x94which is all I want.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this a hint to me, Lizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her father, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto send for the\\r\\n      horses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\r\\n      nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back\\r\\n      by dinner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI admire the activity of your benevolence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Mary, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\n      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\r\\n      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\r\\n      required.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will go as far as Meryton with you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Catherine and\\r\\n      Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\r\\n      ladies set off together.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we make haste,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lydia, as they walked along, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps we\\r\\n      may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings\\r\\n      of one of the officers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk\\r\\n      alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over\\r\\n      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and\\r\\n      finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\r\\n      ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\r\\n      exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\\r\\n      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\\r\\n      surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the\\r\\n      day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible\\r\\n      to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that\\r\\n      they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very\\r\\n      politely by them; and in their brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manners there was\\r\\n      something better than politeness; there was good humour and\\r\\n      kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at\\r\\n      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy\\r\\n      which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the\\r\\n      occasion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\r\\n      thinking only of his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\r\\n      Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\r\\n      not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken\\r\\n      to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the\\r\\n      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note\\r\\n      how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her\\r\\n      entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and\\r\\n      when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little\\r\\n      beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness\\r\\n      she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and\\r\\n      Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\r\\n      affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary\\r\\n      came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\r\\n      supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\r\\n      endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\r\\n      and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,\\r\\n      for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.\\r\\n      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other\\r\\n      ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\\r\\n      nothing to do elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\r\\n      very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\r\\n      and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\r\\n      testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\r\\n      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\r\\n      remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully\\r\\n      consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint\\r\\n      the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n\\r\\n      At five o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\r\\n      six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries\\r\\n      which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of\\r\\n      distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, she\\r\\n      could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means\\r\\n      better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\r\\n      times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a\\r\\n      bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;\\r\\n      and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference\\r\\n      towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth\\r\\n      to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\r\\n      could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was\\r\\n      evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\r\\n      prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed\\r\\n      she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from\\r\\n      any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister\\r\\n      scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he\\r\\n      was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at\\r\\n      cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,\\r\\n      had nothing to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\r\\n      Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her\\r\\n      manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride\\r\\n      and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\r\\n      excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this\\r\\n      morning. She really looked almost wild.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.\\r\\n      Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering\\r\\n      about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so\\r\\n      untidy, so blowsy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\r\\n      deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been\\r\\n      let down to hide it not doing its office.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour picture may be very exact, Louisa,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bingley; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut this\\r\\n      was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked\\r\\n      remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her\\r\\n      dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your\\r\\n      sister_ make such an exhibition.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever\\r\\n      it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what\\r\\n      could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort\\r\\n      of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\r\\n      decorum.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      said Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Miss Bingley, in a half\\r\\n      whisper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat this adventure has rather affected your admiration\\r\\n      of her fine eyes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey were brightened by the exercise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\r\\n      very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\r\\n      settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low\\r\\n      connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\r\\n      Meryton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is capital,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added her sister, and they both laughed\\r\\n      heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\n      Bingley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit would not make them one jot less agreeable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\r\\n      of any consideration in the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\r\\n      their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at\\r\\n      the expense of their dear friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vulgar relations.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room\\r\\n      on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to\\r\\n      coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit\\r\\n      her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of\\r\\n      seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than\\r\\n      pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the\\r\\n      drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was\\r\\n      immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\r\\n      playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse,\\r\\n      said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\\r\\n      below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you prefer reading to cards?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is rather\\r\\n      singular.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Eliza Bennet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdespises cards. She is a\\r\\n      great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\n      Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in\\r\\n      many things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Bingley; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her\\r\\n      quite well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a\\r\\n      table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to\\r\\n      fetch her others; all that his library afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\r\\n      credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I\\r\\n      have more than I ever looked into.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\r\\n      those in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am astonished,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat my father should have\\r\\n      left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\r\\n      you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt ought to be good,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit has been the work of many\\r\\n      generations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always\\r\\n      buying books.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\r\\n      as these.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNeglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\r\\n      beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_\\r\\n      house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish it may.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\r\\n      neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is\\r\\n      not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will\\r\\n      sell it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am talking of possibilities, Charles.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\r\\n      Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her\\r\\n      very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly\\r\\n      aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself\\r\\n      between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill she be as tall as I am?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      height, or rather taller.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\r\\n      delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners!\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so\\r\\n      extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the\\r\\n      pianoforte is exquisite.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is amazing to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bingley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow young ladies can have\\r\\n      patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\r\\n      mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens,\\r\\n      and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this,\\r\\n      and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\r\\n      time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour list of the common extent of accomplishments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Darcy,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who\\r\\n      deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a\\r\\n      screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your\\r\\n      estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more\\r\\n      than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that\\r\\n      are really accomplished.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNor I, I am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou must comprehend a great deal in\\r\\n      your idea of an accomplished woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried his faithful assistant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno one can be\\r\\n      really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\r\\n      usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\r\\n      music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\r\\n      deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a\\r\\n      certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of\\r\\n      her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\r\\n      half deserved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll this she must possess,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand to all this she\\r\\n      must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\r\\n      her mind by extensive reading.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished\\r\\n      women. I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility\\r\\n      of all this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and\\r\\n      taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\r\\n      of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\r\\n      many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called\\r\\n      them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to\\r\\n      what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an\\r\\n      end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEliza Bennet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed\\r\\n      on her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis one of those young ladies who seek to recommend\\r\\n      themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with\\r\\n      many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a\\r\\n      paltry device, a very mean art.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\r\\n      addressed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies\\r\\n      sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears\\r\\n      affinity to cunning is despicable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\r\\n      continue the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\r\\n      worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no\\r\\n      country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to\\r\\n      town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not\\r\\n      hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their\\r\\n      brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be\\r\\n      sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly\\r\\n      better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared\\r\\n      that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\r\\n      however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better\\r\\n      relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions\\r\\n      that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her\\r\\n      sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, and\\r\\n      in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\r\\n      answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\r\\n      elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this\\r\\n      amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\r\\n      Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\r\\n      judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched,\\r\\n      and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon\\r\\n      after the family breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have\\r\\n      been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her\\r\\n      illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\r\\n      immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\r\\n      her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her\\r\\n      daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\r\\n      apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\r\\n      advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\r\\n      Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\r\\n      daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley\\r\\n      met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\r\\n      worse than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I have, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was her answer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is a great deal too\\r\\n      ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\r\\n      We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRemoved!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bingley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must not be thought of. My sister,\\r\\n      I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may depend upon it, Madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, with cold\\r\\n      civility, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention\\r\\n      while she remains with us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif it was not for such good friends I do\\r\\n      not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\r\\n      and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\r\\n      world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\r\\n      exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell\\r\\n      my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room\\r\\n      here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.\\r\\n      I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\r\\n      Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\\r\\n      hope, though you have but a short lease.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever I do is done in a hurry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand therefore if\\r\\n      I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\r\\n      five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\r\\n      fixed here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou begin to comprehend me, do you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he, turning towards\\r\\n      her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes\\xe2\\x80\\x94I understand you perfectly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily\\r\\n      seen through I am afraid is pitiful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate\\r\\n      character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremember where you are, and do not\\r\\n      run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not know before,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Bingley immediately, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you\\r\\n      were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have\\r\\n      at least that advantage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan in general supply but few\\r\\n      subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in\\r\\n      a very confined and unvarying society.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new\\r\\n      to be observed in them for ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of\\r\\n      mentioning a country neighbourhood. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI assure you there is quite\\r\\n      as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\r\\n      moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had\\r\\n      gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\\r\\n      country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The\\r\\n      country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I am in the country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never wish to leave\\r\\n      it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have\\r\\n      each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\r\\n      gentleman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d looking at Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseemed to think the country was\\r\\n      nothing at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Mama, you are mistaken,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, blushing for\\r\\n      her mother. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that\\r\\n      there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the\\r\\n      country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\\r\\n      meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there\\r\\n      are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with\\r\\n      four-and-twenty families.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\r\\n      his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her\\r\\n      eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth,\\r\\n      for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn\\r\\n      since _her_ coming away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man\\r\\n      Sir William is, Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x94is not he? so much the man of\\r\\n      fashion! So genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to\\r\\n      everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons\\r\\n      who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths,\\r\\n      quite mistake the matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid Charlotte dine with you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the\\r\\n      mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants\\r\\n      that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up\\r\\n      differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\r\\n      Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity\\r\\n      they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_\\r\\n      plain\\xe2\\x80\\x94but then she is our particular friend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe seems a very pleasant young woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas\\r\\n      herself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beauty. I do not\\r\\n      like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x94one does not\\r\\n      often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do\\r\\n      not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was\\r\\n      a gentleman at my brother Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in town so much in love with her,\\r\\n      that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before\\r\\n      we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her\\r\\n      too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty\\r\\n      they were.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so ended his affection,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth impatiently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\r\\n      has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder\\r\\n      who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away\\r\\n      love!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what\\r\\n      is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\r\\n      inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\r\\n      entirely away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\r\\n      Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\r\\n      again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\r\\n      and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\r\\n      to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\r\\n      troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil\\r\\n      in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\r\\n      and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed\\r\\n      without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\r\\n      soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the\\r\\n      youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had\\r\\n      been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the\\r\\n      result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with\\r\\n      having promised on his first coming into the country to give a\\r\\n      ball at Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\r\\n      complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her\\r\\n      mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early\\r\\n      age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\r\\n      self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom\\r\\n      her uncle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended\\r\\n      her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore,\\r\\n      to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly\\r\\n      reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\\r\\n      shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to\\r\\n      this sudden attack was delightful to their mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\r\\n      when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\r\\n      very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while\\r\\n      she is ill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia declared herself satisfied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes\\xe2\\x80\\x94it would be much\\r\\n      better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\r\\n      Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given\\r\\n      _your_ ball,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall insist on their giving one\\r\\n      also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he\\r\\n      does not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth\\r\\n      returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n      behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the\\r\\n      latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in\\r\\n      their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s witticisms\\r\\n      on _fine eyes_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n\\r\\n      The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and\\r\\n      Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\\r\\n      invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\\r\\n      evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The\\r\\n      loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and\\r\\n      Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\\r\\n      letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to\\r\\n      his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\r\\n      Hurst was observing their game.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\r\\n      attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The\\r\\n      perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting,\\r\\n      or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter,\\r\\n      with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received,\\r\\n      formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her\\r\\n      opinion of each.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou write uncommonly fast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow many letters you must have occasion to write in the course\\r\\n      of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think\\r\\n      them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to\\r\\n      yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray tell your sister that I long to see her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have already told her so once, by your desire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I\\r\\n      mend pens remarkably well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you\\xe2\\x80\\x94but I always mend my own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can you contrive to write so even?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\\r\\n      the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\\r\\n      her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it\\r\\n      infinitely superior to Miss Grantley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write\\r\\n      again? At present I have not room to do them justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do\\r\\n      you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not\\r\\n      for me to determine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\\r\\n      with ease, cannot write ill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her\\r\\n      brother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too\\r\\n      much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy style of writing is very different from yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Bingley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCharles writes in the most careless\\r\\n      way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the\\r\\n      rest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them\\xe2\\x80\\x94by\\r\\n      which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my\\r\\n      correspondents.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour humility, Mr. Bingley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmust disarm\\r\\n      reproof.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing is more deceitful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthan the appearance of\\r\\n      humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\\r\\n      an indirect boast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of\\r\\n      modesty?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\r\\n      writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity\\r\\n      of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\\r\\n      estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of\\r\\n      doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the\\r\\n      possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\r\\n      the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if\\r\\n      you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in\\r\\n      five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\\r\\n      compliment to yourself\\xe2\\x80\\x94and yet what is there so very laudable in\\r\\n      a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone,\\r\\n      and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bingley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is too much, to remember at night all\\r\\n      the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon\\r\\n      my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I\\r\\n      believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume\\r\\n      the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\\r\\n      the ladies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\r\\n      you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite\\r\\n      as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you\\r\\n      were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Bingley, you had\\r\\n      better stay till next week,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you would probably do it, you would\\r\\n      probably not go\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, at another word, might stay a month.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have only proved by this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown\\r\\n      him off now much more than he did himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am exceedingly gratified,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bingley, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby your converting\\r\\n      what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\\r\\n      temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\\r\\n      gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\\r\\n      the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\\r\\n      denial, and ride off as fast as I could.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\\r\\n      intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must\\r\\n      speak for himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call\\r\\n      mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case,\\r\\n      however, to stand according to your representation, you must\\r\\n      remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire\\r\\n      his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely\\r\\n      desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of\\r\\n      its propriety.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo yield readily\\xe2\\x80\\x94easily\\xe2\\x80\\x94to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no\\r\\n      merit with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo yield without conviction is no compliment to the\\r\\n      understanding of either.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence\\r\\n      of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would\\r\\n      often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for\\r\\n      arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking\\r\\n      of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as\\r\\n      well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we\\r\\n      discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general\\r\\n      and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them\\r\\n      is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great\\r\\n      moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with\\r\\n      the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\r\\n      arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which\\r\\n      is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\\r\\n      intimacy subsisting between the parties?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy all means,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bingley; \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet us hear all the particulars,\\r\\n      not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will\\r\\n      have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\\r\\n      aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall\\r\\n      fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so\\r\\n      much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than\\r\\n      Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his\\r\\n      own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\\r\\n      nothing to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\\r\\n      he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss\\r\\n      Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\\r\\n      expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see your design, Bingley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said his friend. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou dislike an\\r\\n      argument, and want to silence this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and\\r\\n      Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\\r\\n      be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat you ask,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis no sacrifice on my side; and\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\\r\\n      Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved\\r\\n      with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request\\r\\n      that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and\\r\\n      more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\\r\\n      employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over\\r\\n      some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose\\r\\n      that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and\\r\\n      yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still\\r\\n      more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last, that she\\r\\n      drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and\\r\\n      reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other\\r\\n      person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him\\r\\n      too little to care for his approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\\r\\n      by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\\r\\n      near Elizabeth, said to her\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\\r\\n      an opportunity of dancing a reel?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with\\r\\n      some surprise at her silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI heard you before; but I could not immediately\\r\\n      determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\\r\\n      but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and\\r\\n      cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have,\\r\\n      therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\\r\\n      dance a reel at all\\xe2\\x80\\x94and now despise me if you dare.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I do not dare.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\\r\\n      his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\\r\\n      in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\\r\\n      and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by\\r\\n      her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of\\r\\n      her connections, he should be in some danger.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\\r\\n      great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\\r\\n      some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\\r\\n      talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\\r\\n      such an alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, as they were walking together in the\\r\\n      shrubbery the next day, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou will give your mother-in-law a few\\r\\n      hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\\r\\n      of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the\\r\\n      younger girls of running after the officers. And, if I may mention so\\r\\n      delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\\r\\n      bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\\r\\n      possesses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be\\r\\n      placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your\\r\\n      great uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know,\\r\\n      only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s picture, you\\r\\n      must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to\\r\\n      those beautiful eyes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but\\r\\n      their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,\\r\\n      might be copied.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\\r\\n      Elizabeth herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not know that you intended to walk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bingley, in\\r\\n      some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou used us abominably ill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Mrs. Hurst, \\xe2\\x80\\x9crunning away\\r\\n      without telling us that you were coming out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\\r\\n      to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt\\r\\n      their rudeness, and immediately said,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go\\r\\n      into the avenue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\\r\\n      them, laughingly answered,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and\\r\\n      appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by\\r\\n      admitting a fourth. Good-bye.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the\\r\\n      hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so\\r\\n      much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\\r\\n      hours that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\r\\n      sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into\\r\\n      the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with\\r\\n      many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them\\r\\n      so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the\\r\\n      gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were\\r\\n      considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy,\\r\\n      relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance\\r\\n      with spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first\\r\\n      object; Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,\\r\\n      and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many\\r\\n      steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite\\r\\n      congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he\\r\\n      was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery glad;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but diffuseness and warmth remained for\\r\\n      Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first\\r\\n      half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\r\\n      from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the\\r\\n      other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the\\r\\n      door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\r\\n      else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with\\r\\n      great delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\r\\n      card-table\\xe2\\x80\\x94but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence\\r\\n      that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found\\r\\n      even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one\\r\\n      intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the\\r\\n      subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to\\r\\n      do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\r\\n      Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,\\r\\n      principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings,\\r\\n      joined now and then in her brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conversation with Miss\\r\\n      Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own;\\r\\n      and she was perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at\\r\\n      his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he\\r\\n      merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite\\r\\n      exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which\\r\\n      she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she\\r\\n      gave a great yawn and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow pleasant it is to spend an\\r\\n      evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment\\r\\n      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\r\\n      book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I\\r\\n      have not an excellent library.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her\\r\\n      book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\r\\n      amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\r\\n      Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a\\r\\n      dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on\\r\\n      it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much\\r\\n      mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be\\r\\n      rather a punishment than a pleasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you mean Darcy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her brother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che may go to bed, if he\\r\\n      chooses, before it begins\\xe2\\x80\\x94but as for the ball, it is quite a\\r\\n      settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup\\r\\n      enough, I shall send round my cards.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should like balls infinitely better,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif they\\r\\n      were carried on in a different manner; but there is something\\r\\n      insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It\\r\\n      would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\r\\n      dancing were made the order of the day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuch more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\r\\n      not be near so much like a ball.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and\\r\\n      walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked\\r\\n      well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly\\r\\n      studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one\\r\\n      effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and\\r\\n      take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing\\r\\n      after sitting so long in one attitude.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss\\r\\n      Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention\\r\\n      in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously\\r\\n      closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but\\r\\n      he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives\\r\\n      for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with\\r\\n      either of which motives his joining them would interfere. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\n      could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\r\\n      meaning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand\\r\\n      him?\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was her answer; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut depend upon it, he means to be\\r\\n      severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to\\r\\n      ask nothing about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation\\r\\n      of his two motives.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he,\\r\\n      as soon as she allowed him to speak. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou either choose this\\r\\n      method of passing the evening because you are in each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you\\r\\n      are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage\\r\\n      in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and\\r\\n      if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the\\r\\n      fire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! shocking!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Bingley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never heard anything so\\r\\n      abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can all plague and punish one another. Tease\\r\\n      him\\xe2\\x80\\x94laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to\\r\\n      be done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy\\r\\n      has not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and\\r\\n      presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to\\r\\n      laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by\\r\\n      attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug\\r\\n      himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is an\\r\\n      uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it\\r\\n      would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I\\r\\n      dearly love a laugh.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bingley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas given me more credit than can be.\\r\\n      The wisest and the best of men\\xe2\\x80\\x94nay, the wisest and best of their\\r\\n      actions\\xe2\\x80\\x94may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object\\r\\n      in life is a joke.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere are such people, but I hope\\r\\n      I am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and\\r\\n      good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_\\r\\n      divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,\\r\\n      I suppose, are precisely what you are without.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the\\r\\n      study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a\\r\\n      strong understanding to ridicule.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch as vanity and pride.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride\\xe2\\x80\\x94where there is a\\r\\n      real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\\r\\n      regulation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss\\r\\n      Bingley; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand pray what is the result?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He\\r\\n      owns it himself without disguise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have made no such pretension. I have faults\\r\\n      enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I\\r\\n      dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little\\r\\n      yielding\\xe2\\x80\\x94certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I\\r\\n      cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought,\\r\\n      nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed\\r\\n      about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be\\r\\n      called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_That_ is a failing indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cImplacable\\r\\n      resentment _is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your\\r\\n      fault well. I really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some\\r\\n      particular evil\\xe2\\x80\\x94a natural defect, which not even the best\\r\\n      education can overcome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd _your_ defect is to hate everybody.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yours,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied with a smile, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis willfully to\\r\\n      misunderstand them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo let us have a little music,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\r\\n      conversation in which she had no share. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLouisa, you will not\\r\\n      mind my waking Mr. Hurst?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\r\\n      opened; and Darcy, after a few moments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 recollection, was not\\r\\n      sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too\\r\\n      much attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n\\r\\n      In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\\r\\n      wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage\\r\\n      might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till\\r\\n      the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s week,\\r\\n      could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her\\r\\n      answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the\\r\\n      carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that\\r\\n      if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she\\r\\n      could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however,\\r\\n      Elizabeth was positively resolved\\xe2\\x80\\x94nor did she much expect it\\r\\n      would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered\\r\\n      as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled\\r\\n      that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning\\r\\n      should be mentioned, and the request made.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough\\r\\n      was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day\\r\\n      to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.\\r\\n      Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for\\r\\n      her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her\\r\\n      affection for the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to\\r\\n      go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it\\r\\n      would not be safe for her\\xe2\\x80\\x94that she was not enough recovered; but\\r\\n      Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x94Elizabeth had been at\\r\\n      Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\n      Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to\\r\\n      himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no\\r\\n      sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could\\r\\n      elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible\\r\\n      that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the\\r\\n      last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.\\r\\n      Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through\\r\\n      the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by\\r\\n      themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to\\r\\n      his book, and would not even look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to\\r\\n      almost all, took place. Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s civility to Elizabeth\\r\\n      increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for\\r\\n      Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the\\r\\n      pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn\\r\\n      or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook\\r\\n      hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in\\r\\n      the liveliest of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to\\r\\n      give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold\\r\\n      again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions\\r\\n      of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their\\r\\n      importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when\\r\\n      they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and\\r\\n      almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and\\r\\n      human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new\\r\\n      observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and\\r\\n      Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been\\r\\n      done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding\\r\\n      Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their\\r\\n      uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been\\r\\n      hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\r\\n      breakfast the next morning, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you have ordered a good dinner\\r\\n      to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family\\r\\n      party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am\\r\\n      sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I hope\\r\\n      _my_ dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often\\r\\n      sees such at home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes sparkled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA gentleman and a stranger! It is\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\\r\\n      to see Mr. Bingley. But\\xe2\\x80\\x94good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a\\r\\n      bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\r\\n      must speak to Hill this moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her husband; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is a person whom\\r\\n      I never saw in the whole course of my life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\\r\\n      being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\\r\\n      once.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\r\\n      explained:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\\r\\n      ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\\r\\n      requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins,\\r\\n      who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon\\r\\n      as he pleases.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried his wife, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot bear to hear that\\r\\n      mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is\\r\\n      the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be\\r\\n      entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had\\r\\n      been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other\\r\\n      about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an\\r\\n      entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a\\r\\n      subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and\\r\\n      she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an\\r\\n      estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man\\r\\n      whom nobody cared anything about.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand\\r\\n      nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\\r\\n      Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\\r\\n      be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very\\r\\n      impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.\\r\\n      I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling\\r\\n      with you, as his father did before him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\\r\\n      that head, as you will hear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15_th October_.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\\r\\n      honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have\\r\\n      had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal\\r\\n      the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,\\r\\n      fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to\\r\\n      be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him\\r\\n      to be at variance.\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x98There, Mrs. Bennet.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94My mind, however, is now\\r\\n      made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter,\\r\\n      I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage\\r\\n      of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir\\r\\n      Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to\\r\\n      the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest\\r\\n      endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\\r\\n      ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies\\r\\n      which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,\\r\\n      moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing\\r\\n      of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on\\r\\n      these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are\\r\\n      highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in\\r\\n      the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\\r\\n      side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I\\r\\n      cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring\\r\\n      your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as\\r\\n      well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible\\r\\n      amends\\xe2\\x80\\x94but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to\\r\\n      receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of\\r\\n      waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four\\r\\n      o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the\\r\\n      Saturday se\\xe2\\x80\\x99ennight following, which I can do without any\\r\\n      inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my\\r\\n      occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other\\r\\n      clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.\\xe2\\x80\\x94I remain, dear\\r\\n      sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your\\r\\n      well-wisher and friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWILLIAM COLLINS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt four o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\\r\\n      gentleman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\r\\n      seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my\\r\\n      word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\\r\\n      especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him\\r\\n      come to us again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\\r\\n      and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the\\r\\n      person to discourage him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThough it is difficult,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto guess in what way he can\\r\\n      mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\\r\\n      certainly to his credit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\\r\\n      Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\\r\\n      and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe must be an oddity, I think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot make him\\r\\n      out.\\xe2\\x80\\x94There is something very pompous in his style.\\xe2\\x80\\x94And what can\\r\\n      he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?\\xe2\\x80\\x94We cannot\\r\\n      suppose he would help it if he could.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Could he be a sensible man,\\r\\n      sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him\\r\\n      quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and\\r\\n      self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am\\r\\n      impatient to see him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn point of composition,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mary, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe letter does not seem\\r\\n      defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\\r\\n      new, yet I think it is well expressed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in\\r\\n      any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their\\r\\n      cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks\\r\\n      since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any\\r\\n      other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter had done\\r\\n      away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with\\r\\n      a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\r\\n      politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little;\\r\\n      but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed\\r\\n      neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent\\r\\n      himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\\r\\n      five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners\\r\\n      were very formal. He had not been long seated before he\\r\\n      complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters;\\r\\n      said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance\\r\\n      fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\\r\\n      doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.\\r\\n      This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers;\\r\\n      but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most\\r\\n      readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\\r\\n      may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are\\r\\n      settled so oddly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,\\r\\n      you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for\\r\\n      such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no\\r\\n      knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\\r\\n      and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\\r\\n      appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young\\r\\n      ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not\\r\\n      say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\\r\\n      on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture,\\r\\n      were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything\\r\\n      would have touched Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart, but for the mortifying\\r\\n      supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The\\r\\n      dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know\\r\\n      to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was\\r\\n      owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him\\r\\n      with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\\r\\n      cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He\\r\\n      begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she\\r\\n      declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to\\r\\n      apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n      During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the\\r\\n      servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some\\r\\n      conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\\r\\n      which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very\\r\\n      fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention\\r\\n      to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very\\r\\n      remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins\\r\\n      was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than\\r\\n      usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he\\r\\n      protested that \\xe2\\x80\\x9che had never in his life witnessed such behaviour\\r\\n      in a person of rank\\xe2\\x80\\x94such affability and condescension, as he had\\r\\n      himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously\\r\\n      pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already\\r\\n      had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him\\r\\n      twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday\\r\\n      before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady\\r\\n      Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had\\r\\n      never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken\\r\\n      to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the\\r\\n      smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\r\\n      neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a\\r\\n      week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to\\r\\n      advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with\\r\\n      discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble\\r\\n      parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\r\\n      he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\\r\\n      herself\\xe2\\x80\\x94some shelves in the closet up stairs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that\\r\\n      great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near\\r\\n      you, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by\\r\\n      a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\r\\n      extensive property.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen she is better off\\r\\n      than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she\\r\\n      handsome?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself\\r\\n      says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far\\r\\n      superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in\\r\\n      her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\r\\n      She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has\\r\\n      prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments\\r\\n      which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by\\r\\n      the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides\\r\\n      with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to\\r\\n      drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas she been presented? I do not remember her name among the\\r\\n      ladies at court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\\r\\n      town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has\\r\\n      deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her\\r\\n      ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I\\r\\n      am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate\\r\\n      compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more\\r\\n      than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter\\r\\n      seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank,\\r\\n      instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These\\r\\n      are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it\\r\\n      is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound\\r\\n      to pay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou judge very properly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand it is happy for\\r\\n      you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May\\r\\n      I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse\\r\\n      of the moment, or are the result of previous study?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though\\r\\n      I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such\\r\\n      little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary\\r\\n      occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as\\r\\n      possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as\\r\\n      absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest\\r\\n      enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute\\r\\n      composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at\\r\\n      Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet\\r\\n      was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when\\r\\n      tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr.\\r\\n      Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on\\r\\n      beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a\\r\\n      circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\r\\n      protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and\\r\\n      Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some\\r\\n      deliberation he chose Fordyce\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened\\r\\n      the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity,\\r\\n      read three pages, she interrupted him with:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\\r\\n      Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt\\r\\n      told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow\\r\\n      to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from\\r\\n      town.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but\\r\\n      Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\\r\\n      books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their\\r\\n      benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be\\r\\n      nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no\\r\\n      longer importune my young cousin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist\\r\\n      at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that\\r\\n      he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling\\r\\n      amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly\\r\\n      for Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interruption, and promised that it should not occur\\r\\n      again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after\\r\\n      assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and\\r\\n      should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself\\r\\n      at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature\\r\\n      had been but little assisted by education or society; the\\r\\n      greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of\\r\\n      an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one\\r\\n      of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms,\\r\\n      without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in\\r\\n      which his father had brought him up had given him originally\\r\\n      great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted\\r\\n      by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the\\r\\n      consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A\\r\\n      fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\r\\n      when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\\r\\n      felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his\\r\\n      patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his\\r\\n      authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him\\r\\n      altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance\\r\\n      and humility.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended\\r\\n      to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn\\r\\n      family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the\\r\\n      daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were\\r\\n      represented by common report. This was his plan of amends\\xe2\\x80\\x94of\\r\\n      atonement\\xe2\\x80\\x94for inheriting their father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estate; and he thought it\\r\\n      an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and\\r\\n      excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.\\r\\n\\r\\n      His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lovely face\\r\\n      confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of\\r\\n      what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was\\r\\n      his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an\\r\\n      alteration; for in a quarter of an hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s _t\\xc3\\xaate-\\xc3\\xa0-t\\xc3\\xaate_ with Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his\\r\\n      parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his\\r\\n      hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn,\\r\\n      produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\r\\n      encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs to her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to\\r\\n      say\\xe2\\x80\\x94she could not positively answer\\xe2\\x80\\x94but she did not _know_ of any\\r\\n      prepossession; her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention\\xe2\\x80\\x94she\\r\\n      felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon\\r\\n      engaged.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it was\\r\\n      soon done\\xe2\\x80\\x94done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\\r\\n      Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded\\r\\n      her of course.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might\\r\\n      soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not\\r\\n      bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every\\r\\n      sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to\\r\\n      attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious\\r\\n      to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither\\r\\n      Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would\\r\\n      continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the\\r\\n      collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little\\r\\n      cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings\\r\\n      discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\r\\n      always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as\\r\\n      he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other\\r\\n      room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\\r\\n      civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to\\r\\n      join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact\\r\\n      much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely\\r\\n      pleased to close his large book, and go.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\r\\n      cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The\\r\\n      attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by\\r\\n      _him_. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in\\r\\n      quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet\\r\\n      indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall\\r\\n      them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\\r\\n      whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike\\r\\n      appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the\\r\\n      way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return\\r\\n      from London Lydia came to enquire, and he bowed as they passed.\\r\\n      All were struck with the stranger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s air, all wondered who he\\r\\n      could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find\\r\\n      out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting\\r\\n      something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained\\r\\n      the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached\\r\\n      the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\\r\\n      permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned\\r\\n      with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had\\r\\n      accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it\\r\\n      should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him\\r\\n      completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he\\r\\n      had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good\\r\\n      figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed\\r\\n      up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation\\xe2\\x80\\x94a readiness\\r\\n      at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole\\r\\n      party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\\r\\n      when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley\\r\\n      were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of\\r\\n      the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\\r\\n      began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,\\r\\n      and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on\\r\\n      his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to\\r\\n      fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by\\r\\n      the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the\\r\\n      countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all\\r\\n      astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\\r\\n      one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few\\r\\n      moments, touched his hat\\xe2\\x80\\x94a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\\r\\n      deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was\\r\\n      impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have\\r\\n      noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the\\r\\n      door of Mr. Phillip\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house, and then made their bows, in spite\\r\\n      of Miss Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and\\r\\n      even in spite of Mrs. Phillips\\xe2\\x80\\x99s throwing up the parlour window\\r\\n      and loudly seconding the invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two\\r\\n      eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and\\r\\n      she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return\\r\\n      home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she\\r\\n      should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see\\r\\n      Mr. Jones\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they\\r\\n      were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the\\r\\n      Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\\r\\n      towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s introduction of him. She received\\r\\n      him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much\\r\\n      more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\\r\\n      acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering\\r\\n      himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the\\r\\n      young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was\\r\\n      quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her\\r\\n      contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by\\r\\n      exclamations and enquiries about the other; of whom, however, she\\r\\n      could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny\\r\\n      had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\r\\n      lieutenant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commission in the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire. She had been watching him\\r\\n      the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and\\r\\n      had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have\\r\\n      continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now\\r\\n      except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the\\r\\n      stranger, were become \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstupid, disagreeable fellows.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some of\\r\\n      them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their\\r\\n      aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give\\r\\n      him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come\\r\\n      in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested\\r\\n      that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\r\\n      tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect\\r\\n      of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual\\r\\n      good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the\\r\\n      room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were\\r\\n      perfectly needless.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen\\r\\n      pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have\\r\\n      defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong,\\r\\n      she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by\\r\\n      admiring Mrs. Phillips\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manners and politeness. He protested\\r\\n      that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a\\r\\n      more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the\\r\\n      utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her\\r\\n      invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her\\r\\n      before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\r\\n      connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\\r\\n      attention in the whole course of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n      As no objection was made to the young people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engagement with\\r\\n      their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scruples of leaving Mr. and\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\\r\\n      steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at\\r\\n      a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\\r\\n      hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had\\r\\n      accepted their uncle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invitation, and was then in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When this information was given, and they had all taken their\\r\\n      seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\\r\\n      and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\\r\\n      apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself\\r\\n      in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison\\r\\n      that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its\\r\\n      proprietor\\xe2\\x80\\x94when she had listened to the description of only one\\r\\n      of Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drawing-rooms, and found that the\\r\\n      chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\r\\n      the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a\\r\\n      comparison with the housekeeper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\\r\\n      mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\\r\\n      abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\\r\\n      employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his\\r\\n      consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving\\r\\n      to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To\\r\\n      the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had\\r\\n      nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their\\r\\n      own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the\\r\\n      interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last,\\r\\n      however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked\\r\\n      into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing\\r\\n      him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree\\r\\n      of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire were in\\r\\n      general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of\\r\\n      them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond\\r\\n      them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were\\r\\n      superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing\\r\\n      port wine, who followed them into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female\\r\\n      eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he\\r\\n      finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he\\r\\n      immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its\\r\\n      being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest,\\r\\n      most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill\\r\\n      of the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\\r\\n      the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\\r\\n      the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\\r\\n      intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\\r\\n      watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\r\\n      When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\\r\\n      obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know little of the game at present,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I shall be\\r\\n      glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for\\r\\n      his reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\r\\n      received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first\\r\\n      there seemed danger of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engrossing him entirely, for she\\r\\n      was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond\\r\\n      of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\\r\\n      game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\\r\\n      have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common\\r\\n      demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk\\r\\n      to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what\\r\\n      she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\r\\n      history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\\r\\n      mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\r\\n      relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He enquired how\\r\\n      far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her\\r\\n      answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been\\r\\n      staying there.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout a month,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\\r\\n      subject drop, added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is a man of very large property in\\r\\n      Derbyshire, I understand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Wickham; \\xe2\\x80\\x9chis estate there is a noble one. A\\r\\n      clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a\\r\\n      person more capable of giving you certain information on that\\r\\n      head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a\\r\\n      particular manner from my infancy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not but look surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\\r\\n      after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\\r\\n      meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs much as I ever wish to be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth very warmly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\n      have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him\\r\\n      very disagreeable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no right to give _my_ opinion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wickham, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas to his\\r\\n      being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I\\r\\n      have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is\\r\\n      impossible for _me_ to be impartial. But I believe your opinion\\r\\n      of him would in general astonish\\xe2\\x80\\x94and perhaps you would not\\r\\n      express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your\\r\\n      own family.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house\\r\\n      in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked\\r\\n      in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will\\r\\n      not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot pretend to be sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wickham, after a short\\r\\n      interruption, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat he or that any man should not be estimated\\r\\n      beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often\\r\\n      happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or\\r\\n      frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as\\r\\n      he chooses to be seen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\n      ill-tempered man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wickham only shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away\\r\\n      when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If\\r\\n      _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on\\r\\n      friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\\r\\n      have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim\\r\\n      before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\\r\\n      painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet,\\r\\n      the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\\r\\n      and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\\r\\n      with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\r\\n      thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\n      scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\n      everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\\r\\n      disgracing the memory of his father.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and\\r\\n      listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented\\r\\n      further enquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\r\\n      neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\\r\\n      that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\\r\\n      very intelligible gallantry.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\n      added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich was my chief inducement to enter the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire. I\\r\\n      knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend\\r\\n      Denny tempted me further by his account of their present\\r\\n      quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\\r\\n      acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is\\r\\n      necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\\r\\n      will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society. A\\r\\n      military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\\r\\n      have now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my\\r\\n      profession\\xe2\\x80\\x94I was brought up for the church, and I should at this\\r\\n      time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\\r\\n      pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x94the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of\\r\\n      the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively\\r\\n      attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to\\r\\n      provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the\\r\\n      living fell, it was given elsewhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut how could _that_ be? How\\r\\n      could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal\\r\\n      redress?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\\r\\n      as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have\\r\\n      doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it\\xe2\\x80\\x94or to\\r\\n      treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert\\r\\n      that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,\\r\\n      imprudence\\xe2\\x80\\x94in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the\\r\\n      living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to\\r\\n      hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less\\r\\n      certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\r\\n      anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper,\\r\\n      and I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\\r\\n      freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are\\r\\n      very different sort of men, and that he hates me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome time or other he _will_ be\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it shall not be by _me_.\\r\\n      Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\\r\\n      handsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, after a pause, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan have been his motive?\\r\\n      What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA thorough, determined dislike of me\\xe2\\x80\\x94a dislike which I cannot\\r\\n      but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his\\r\\n      father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very\\r\\n      early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of\\r\\n      competition in which we stood\\xe2\\x80\\x94the sort of preference which was\\r\\n      often given me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this\\xe2\\x80\\x94though I have never\\r\\n      liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed\\r\\n      him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not\\r\\n      suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such\\r\\n      injustice, such inhumanity as this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      After a few minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reflection, however, she continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI _do_\\r\\n      remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\\r\\n      implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\\r\\n      temper. His disposition must be dreadful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not trust myself on the subject,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Wickham; \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_I_\\r\\n      can hardly be just to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite\\r\\n      of his father!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She could have added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA young man, too, like\\r\\n      _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\\r\\n      amiable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94but she contented herself with, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand one, too, who had\\r\\n      probably been his companion from childhood, connected together,\\r\\n      as I think you said, in the closest manner!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\\r\\n      greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\\r\\n      same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\\r\\n      parental care. _My_ father began life in the profession which\\r\\n      your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to\\xe2\\x80\\x94but he\\r\\n      gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted\\r\\n      all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most\\r\\n      highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential\\r\\n      friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the\\r\\n      greatest obligations to my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s active superintendence, and\\r\\n      when, immediately before my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\r\\n      voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he\\r\\n      felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his\\r\\n      affection to myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow strange!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow abominable! I wonder that\\r\\n      the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If\\r\\n      from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to\\r\\n      be dishonest\\xe2\\x80\\x94for dishonesty I must call it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt _is_ wonderful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Wickham, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor almost all his actions\\r\\n      may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\r\\n      It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\\r\\n      feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\\r\\n      to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give\\r\\n      his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants,\\r\\n      and relieve the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride\\xe2\\x80\\x94for he is\\r\\n      very proud of what his father was\\xe2\\x80\\x94have done this. Not to appear\\r\\n      to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities,\\r\\n      or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful\\r\\n      motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_\\r\\n      brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian\\r\\n      of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the\\r\\n      most attentive and best of brothers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He shook his head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish I could call her amiable. It gives me\\r\\n      pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her\\r\\n      brother\\xe2\\x80\\x94very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and\\r\\n      pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and\\r\\n      hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a\\r\\n      handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand,\\r\\n      highly accomplished. Since her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death, her home has been\\r\\n      London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\r\\n      education.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\\r\\n      could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\\r\\n      truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they\\r\\n      suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know\\r\\n      what Mr. Darcy is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProbably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does\\r\\n      not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he\\r\\n      thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals\\r\\n      in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\\r\\n      less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\\r\\n      he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\\r\\n      perhaps agreeable\\xe2\\x80\\x94allowing something for fortune and figure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered\\r\\n      round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between\\r\\n      his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual enquiries as to\\r\\n      his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great;\\r\\n      he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express\\r\\n      her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity\\r\\n      that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the\\r\\n      money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make\\r\\n      herself uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know very well, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat when persons sit down\\r\\n      to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things,\\r\\n      and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five\\r\\n      shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not\\r\\n      say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am\\r\\n      removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention was caught; and after observing Mr.\\r\\n      Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\\r\\n      whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\\r\\n      family of de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas very lately given\\r\\n      him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced\\r\\n      to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne\\r\\n      Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\r\\n      yesterday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\\r\\n      and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\\r\\n      estates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\\r\\n      Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\\r\\n      useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself,\\r\\n      if he were already self-destined for another.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Collins,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine\\r\\n      and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\\r\\n      of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that\\r\\n      in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant,\\r\\n      conceited woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe her to be both in a great degree,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Wickham; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\n      have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I\\r\\n      never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\\r\\n      insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and\\r\\n      clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\\r\\n      from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\\r\\n      and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that\\r\\n      everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the\\r\\n      first class.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of\\r\\n      it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction\\r\\n      till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies\\r\\n      their share of Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attentions. There could be no\\r\\n      conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supper party, but\\r\\n      his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was\\r\\n      said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went\\r\\n      away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but\\r\\n      there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went,\\r\\n      for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked\\r\\n      incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\r\\n      fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of\\r\\n      Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least\\r\\n      regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper,\\r\\n      and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to\\r\\n      say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at\\r\\n      Longbourn House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and\\r\\n      concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so\\r\\n      unworthy of Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regard; and yet, it was not in her\\r\\n      nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable\\r\\n      appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having endured such\\r\\n      unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and\\r\\n      nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them\\r\\n      both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account\\r\\n      of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey have both,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeen deceived, I dare say, in some\\r\\n      way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people\\r\\n      have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short,\\r\\n      impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which\\r\\n      may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to\\r\\n      say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been\\r\\n      concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be\\r\\n      obliged to think ill of somebody.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\r\\n      opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful\\r\\n      light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite\\r\\n      in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide\\r\\n      for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had\\r\\n      any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most\\r\\n      intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being imposed on,\\r\\n      than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as\\r\\n      he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without\\r\\n      ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides,\\r\\n      there was truth in his looks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is difficult indeed\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is distressing. One does not know what\\r\\n      to think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Jane could think with certainty on only one point\\xe2\\x80\\x94that Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer\\r\\n      when the affair became public.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\r\\n      conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom\\r\\n      they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give\\r\\n      their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at\\r\\n      Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two\\r\\n      ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it\\r\\n      an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been\\r\\n      doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the\\r\\n      family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much\\r\\n      as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\\r\\n      the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats\\r\\n      with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\\r\\n      hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s civilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to\\r\\n      every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as\\r\\n      given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly\\r\\n      flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,\\r\\n      instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy\\r\\n      evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of\\r\\n      their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a\\r\\n      great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of\\r\\n      everything in Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look and behaviour. The happiness\\r\\n      anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\r\\n      event, or any particular person, for though they each, like\\r\\n      Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he\\r\\n      was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a\\r\\n      ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her\\r\\n      family that she had no disinclination for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile I can have my mornings to myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is\\r\\n      enough\\xe2\\x80\\x94I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening\\r\\n      engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself\\r\\n      one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement\\r\\n      as desirable for everybody.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though\\r\\n      she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could\\r\\n      not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to\\r\\n      join in the evening\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amusement; and she was rather surprised to\\r\\n      find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and\\r\\n      was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,\\r\\n      or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat a\\r\\n      ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to\\r\\n      respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far\\r\\n      from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\\r\\n      honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of\\r\\n      the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,\\r\\n      Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference\\r\\n      which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause,\\r\\n      and not to any disrespect for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully\\r\\n      proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and\\r\\n      to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse\\r\\n      timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happiness\\r\\n      and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr.\\r\\n      Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.\\r\\n      She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea\\r\\n      it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that\\r\\n      _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being\\r\\n      mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\r\\n      quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible\\r\\n      visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed\\r\\n      his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent\\r\\n      attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more\\r\\n      astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms,\\r\\n      it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the\\r\\n      probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_.\\r\\n      Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well\\r\\n      aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any\\r\\n      reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did,\\r\\n      it was useless to quarrel about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk\\r\\n      of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable\\r\\n      state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the\\r\\n      day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented\\r\\n      their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news\\r\\n      could be sought after\\xe2\\x80\\x94the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were\\r\\n      got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her\\r\\n      patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of\\r\\n      her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance\\r\\n      on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\\r\\n      Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n      Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and\\r\\n      looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats\\r\\n      there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred\\r\\n      to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any\\r\\n      of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed\\r\\n      her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in\\r\\n      the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained\\r\\n      unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might\\r\\n      be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\\r\\n      dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      pleasure in the Bingleys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 invitation to the officers; and though\\r\\n      this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence\\r\\n      was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly\\r\\n      applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to\\r\\n      town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;\\r\\n      adding, with a significant smile, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not imagine his business\\r\\n      would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to\\r\\n      avoid a certain gentleman here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\\r\\n      caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\\r\\n      less answerable for Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absence than if her first surmise\\r\\n      had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former\\r\\n      was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could\\r\\n      hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries\\r\\n      which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,\\r\\n      forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was\\r\\n      resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned\\r\\n      away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly\\r\\n      surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality\\r\\n      provoked her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\\r\\n      prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not\\r\\n      dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to\\r\\n      Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon\\r\\n      able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her\\r\\n      cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first\\r\\n      two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\r\\n      dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\r\\n      apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without\\r\\n      being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\\r\\n      disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment\\r\\n      of her release from him was ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of\\r\\n      talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\r\\n      When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and\\r\\n      was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly\\r\\n      addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his\\r\\n      application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she\\r\\n      accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left\\r\\n      to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to\\r\\n      console her:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\r\\n      To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not\\r\\n      wish me such an evil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to\\r\\n      claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a\\r\\n      whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham\\r\\n      to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his\\r\\n      consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the\\r\\n      set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being\\r\\n      allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her\\r\\n      neighbours\\xe2\\x80\\x99 looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They\\r\\n      stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\r\\n      imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances,\\r\\n      and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying\\r\\n      that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige\\r\\n      him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He\\r\\n      replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she\\r\\n      addressed him a second time with:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is _your_ turn to say\\r\\n      something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_\\r\\n      ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the\\r\\n      number of couples.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\\r\\n      should be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by\\r\\n      I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public\\r\\n      ones. But _now_ we may be silent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd\\r\\n      to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the\\r\\n      advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as\\r\\n      that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\\r\\n      you imagine that you are gratifying mine?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth archly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor I have always seen a great\\r\\n      similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\\r\\n      taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\r\\n      something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\r\\n      posterity with all the _\\xc3\\xa9clat_ of a proverb.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am\\r\\n      sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend\\r\\n      to say. _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must not decide on my own performance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\\r\\n      down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not\\r\\n      very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and,\\r\\n      unable to resist the temptation, added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you met us there\\r\\n      the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread\\r\\n      his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though\\r\\n      blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length\\r\\n      Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Wickham is\\r\\n      blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_\\r\\n      friends\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is\\r\\n      less certain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\n      Elizabeth with emphasis, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand in a manner which he is likely to\\r\\n      suffer from all his life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the\\r\\n      subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to\\r\\n      them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the\\r\\n      room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of\\r\\n      superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his\\r\\n      partner.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\\r\\n      superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong\\r\\n      to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair\\r\\n      partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this\\r\\n      pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable\\r\\n      event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall\\r\\n      take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy:\\xe2\\x80\\x94but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank\\r\\n      me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young\\r\\n      lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\\r\\n      Sir William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him\\r\\n      forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious\\r\\n      expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\r\\n      Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,\\r\\n      and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interruption has made me forget what we\\r\\n      were talking of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not\\r\\n      have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for\\r\\n      themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without\\r\\n      success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat think you of books?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBooks\\xe2\\x80\\x94oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the\\r\\n      same feelings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at\\r\\n      least be no want of subject. We may compare our different\\r\\n      opinions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo\\xe2\\x80\\x94I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full\\r\\n      of something else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe _present_ always occupies you in such scenes\\xe2\\x80\\x94does it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      he, with a look of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, always,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied, without knowing what she said, for\\r\\n      her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\\r\\n      afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember\\r\\n      hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,\\r\\n      that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very\\r\\n      cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created?_\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, with a firm voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is particularly incumbent on those who never change their\\r\\n      opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay I ask to what these questions tend?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMerely to the illustration of _your_ character,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she,\\r\\n      endeavouring to shake off her gravity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am trying to make it\\r\\n      out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what is your success?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She shook her head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not get on at all. I hear such\\r\\n      different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can readily believe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered he gravely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat reports may\\r\\n      vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,\\r\\n      that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,\\r\\n      as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no\\r\\n      credit on either.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\r\\n      opportunity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he coldly\\r\\n      replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and\\r\\n      parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to\\r\\n      an equal degree, for in Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breast there was a tolerably\\r\\n      powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and\\r\\n      directed all his anger against another.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her,\\r\\n      and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\\r\\n      Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking\\r\\n      me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite\\r\\n      forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was\\r\\n      the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steward. Let me\\r\\n      recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\\r\\n      confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s using him\\r\\n      ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always\\r\\n      been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the\\r\\n      particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\\r\\n      least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\\r\\n      mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not\\r\\n      well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\r\\n      was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\\r\\n      way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\\r\\n      indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\\r\\n      Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guilt; but\\r\\n      really, considering his descent, one could not expect much\\r\\n      better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\r\\n      same,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth angrily; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor I have heard you accuse him\\r\\n      of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steward,\\r\\n      and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\\r\\n      sneer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcuse my interference\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was kindly meant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInsolent girl!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth to herself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are much\\r\\n      mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as\\r\\n      this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\\r\\n      malice of Mr. Darcy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She then sought her eldest sister, who had\\r\\n      undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane\\r\\n      met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such\\r\\n      happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\r\\n      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth\\r\\n      instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\\r\\n      Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else,\\r\\n      gave way before the hope of Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being in the fairest way for\\r\\n      happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, with a countenance no less smiling\\r\\n      than her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But\\r\\n      perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any\\r\\n      third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\n      satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\r\\n      his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which\\r\\n      have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the\\r\\n      good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is\\r\\n      perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less\\r\\n      attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to\\r\\n      say by his account as well as his sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Mr. Wickham is by no\\r\\n      means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very\\r\\n      imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\r\\n      satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\\r\\n      heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it\\r\\n      was left to him _conditionally_ only.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sincerity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth\\r\\n      warmly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances\\r\\n      only. Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defense of his friend was a very able one, I\\r\\n      dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the\\r\\n      story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall\\r\\n      venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\\r\\n      and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth\\r\\n      listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which\\r\\n      Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regard, and said all in her\\r\\n      power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose\\r\\n      enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had\\r\\n      scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told\\r\\n      her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\\r\\n      to make a most important discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have found out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby a singular accident, that there\\r\\n      is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to\\r\\n      overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who\\r\\n      does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de\\r\\n      Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these\\r\\n      sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with,\\r\\n      perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I\\r\\n      am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay\\r\\n      my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will\\r\\n      excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the\\r\\n      connection must plead my apology.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it\\r\\n      earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s _nephew_. It will\\r\\n      be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well\\r\\n      yesterday se\\xe2\\x80\\x99nnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring\\r\\n      him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without\\r\\n      introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment\\r\\n      to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should\\r\\n      be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong\\r\\n      to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the\\r\\n      acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air\\r\\n      of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,\\r\\n      replied thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world\\r\\n      in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of\\r\\n      your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a\\r\\n      wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst\\r\\n      the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me\\r\\n      leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in\\r\\n      point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom\\xe2\\x80\\x94provided\\r\\n      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time\\r\\n      maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of\\r\\n      my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I\\r\\n      look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\\r\\n      your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\\r\\n      guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted\\r\\n      by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a\\r\\n      young lady like yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And with a low bow he left her to\\r\\n      attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly\\r\\n      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very\\r\\n      evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and\\r\\n      though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it\\r\\n      all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9capology,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHunsford,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine de Bourgh.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It vexed her to see\\r\\n      him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\r\\n      unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\r\\n      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\\r\\n      of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\\r\\n      slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no reason, I assure you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto be dissatisfied\\r\\n      with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\\r\\n      attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid\\r\\n      me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady\\r\\n      Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a\\r\\n      favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon\\r\\n      the whole, I am much pleased with him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she\\r\\n      turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her\\r\\n      observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\\r\\n      Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\\r\\n      felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\\r\\n      felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\\r\\n      like Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two sisters. Her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughts she plainly saw\\r\\n      were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\\r\\n      her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,\\r\\n      therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\\r\\n      placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to\\r\\n      find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)\\r\\n      freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane\\r\\n      would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating\\r\\n      subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while\\r\\n      enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a\\r\\n      charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from\\r\\n      them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was\\r\\n      such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,\\r\\n      and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\\r\\n      she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her\\r\\n      younger daughters, as Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marrying so greatly must throw them\\r\\n      in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at\\r\\n      her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to\\r\\n      the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go\\r\\n      into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this\\r\\n      circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it\\r\\n      is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to\\r\\n      find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\\r\\n      concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be\\r\\n      equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing\\r\\n      there was no chance of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\\r\\n      mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a\\r\\n      less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she\\r\\n      could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy,\\r\\n      who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being\\r\\n      nonsensical.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I\\r\\n      am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged\\r\\n      to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor heaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be\\r\\n      for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to\\r\\n      his friend by so doing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her\\r\\n      mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\r\\n      Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She\\r\\n      could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though\\r\\n      every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was\\r\\n      not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his\\r\\n      attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face\\r\\n      changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\r\\n      steady gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\\r\\n      Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights\\r\\n      which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts\\r\\n      of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not\\r\\n      long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,\\r\\n      singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing\\r\\n      Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\\r\\n      company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she\\r\\n      endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;\\r\\n      Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting\\r\\n      was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes\\r\\n      were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched\\r\\n      her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which\\r\\n      was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,\\r\\n      amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she\\r\\n      might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of\\r\\n      half a minute began another. Mary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s powers were by no means\\r\\n      fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner\\r\\n      affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see\\r\\n      how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.\\r\\n      She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of\\r\\n      derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\r\\n      imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\r\\n      interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the\\r\\n      hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long\\r\\n      enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;\\r\\n      and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech,\\r\\n      was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were\\r\\n      now applied to.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Collins, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere so fortunate as to be able to\\r\\n      sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the\\r\\n      company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent\\r\\n      diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a\\r\\n      clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be\\r\\n      justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there\\r\\n      are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a\\r\\n      parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an\\r\\n      agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\r\\n      offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the\\r\\n      time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and\\r\\n      the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be\\r\\n      excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not\\r\\n      think it of light importance that he should have attentive and\\r\\n      conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those\\r\\n      to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;\\r\\n      nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of\\r\\n      testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\\r\\n      family.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,\\r\\n      which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.\\r\\n      Many stared\\xe2\\x80\\x94many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\\r\\n      Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins\\r\\n      for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to\\r\\n      Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young\\r\\n      man.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\\r\\n      to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it\\r\\n      would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more\\r\\n      spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley\\r\\n      and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his\\r\\n      notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much\\r\\n      distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his\\r\\n      two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an\\r\\n      opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she\\r\\n      could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman,\\r\\n      or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was\\r\\n      teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her\\r\\n      side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him\\r\\n      again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did\\r\\n      she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to\\r\\n      introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that\\r\\n      as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief\\r\\n      object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and\\r\\n      that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\\r\\n      the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She\\r\\n      owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often\\r\\n      joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      conversation to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s further\\r\\n      notice; though often standing within a very short distance of\\r\\n      her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She\\r\\n      felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\\r\\n      and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their\\r\\n      carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,\\r\\n      which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by\\r\\n      some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened\\r\\n      their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently\\r\\n      impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every\\r\\n      attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\\r\\n      languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by\\r\\n      the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment,\\r\\n      and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their\\r\\n      behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet,\\r\\n      in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane\\r\\n      were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and\\r\\n      talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\r\\n      silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was\\r\\n      too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation\\r\\n      of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLord, how tired I am!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d accompanied by a violent yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\\r\\n      pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at\\r\\n      Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to\\r\\n      assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner\\r\\n      with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal\\r\\n      invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily\\r\\n      engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,\\r\\n      after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the\\r\\n      next day for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under\\r\\n      the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary\\r\\n      preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,\\r\\n      she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in\\r\\n      the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter\\r\\n      married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and\\r\\n      with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the\\r\\n      least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the\\r\\n      match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was\\r\\n      eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n      The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made\\r\\n      his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of\\r\\n      time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following\\r\\n      Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it\\r\\n      distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a\\r\\n      very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed\\r\\n      a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after\\r\\n      breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter\\r\\n      Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience\\r\\n      with her in the course of this morning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear!\\xe2\\x80\\x94yes\\xe2\\x80\\x94certainly. I am\\r\\n      sure Lizzy will be very happy\\xe2\\x80\\x94I am sure she can have no\\r\\n      objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And, gathering her\\r\\n      work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must\\r\\n      excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not\\r\\n      hear. I am going away myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      And upon Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed\\r\\n      looks, about to escape, she added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy, I _insist_ upon your\\r\\n      staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction\\xe2\\x80\\x94and a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to\\r\\n      get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down\\r\\n      again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings\\r\\n      which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins\\r\\n      began.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBelieve me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far\\r\\n      from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\\r\\n      perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had\\r\\n      there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to\\r\\n      assure you, that I have your respected mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s permission for\\r\\n      this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,\\r\\n      however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\r\\n      attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as\\r\\n      I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my\\r\\n      future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\r\\n      subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons\\r\\n      for marrying\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with\\r\\n      the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run\\r\\n      away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that\\r\\n      she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to\\r\\n      stop him further, and he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right\\r\\n      thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to\\r\\n      set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am\\r\\n      convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and\\r\\n      thirdly\\xe2\\x80\\x94which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it\\r\\n      is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble\\r\\n      lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she\\r\\n      condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\r\\n      subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\r\\n      Hunsford\\xe2\\x80\\x94between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\r\\n      arranging Miss de Bourgh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s footstool, that she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose\\r\\n      properly, choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_,\\r\\n      let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high,\\r\\n      but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice.\\r\\n      Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and\\r\\n      I will visit her.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair\\r\\n      cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady\\r\\n      Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my\\r\\n      power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can\\r\\n      describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable\\r\\n      to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\\r\\n      which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\r\\n      intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my\\r\\n      views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own\\r\\n      neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable\\r\\n      young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit\\r\\n      this estate after the death of your honoured father (who,\\r\\n      however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself\\r\\n      without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\r\\n      the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the\\r\\n      melancholy event takes place\\xe2\\x80\\x94which, however, as I have already\\r\\n      said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my\\r\\n      fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your\\r\\n      esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the\\r\\n      most animated language of the violence of my affection. To\\r\\n      fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of\\r\\n      that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could\\r\\n      not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four\\r\\n      per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\r\\n      therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure\\r\\n      yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when\\r\\n      we are married.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are too hasty, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou forget that I have made\\r\\n      no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my\\r\\n      thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible\\r\\n      of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to\\r\\n      do otherwise than to decline them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not now to learn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\\r\\n      of the hand, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat it is usual with young ladies to reject the\\r\\n      addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he\\r\\n      first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is\\r\\n      repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no\\r\\n      means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to\\r\\n      lead you to the altar ere long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyour hope is a rather\\r\\n      extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am\\r\\n      not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)\\r\\n      who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of\\r\\n      being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\r\\n      You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the\\r\\n      last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your\\r\\n      friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find\\r\\n      me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWere it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\n      Collins very gravely\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I cannot imagine that her ladyship\\r\\n      would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I\\r\\n      have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very\\r\\n      highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable\\r\\n      qualification.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\\r\\n      must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\\r\\n      of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and\\r\\n      by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being\\r\\n      otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the\\r\\n      delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take\\r\\n      possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any\\r\\n      self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as\\r\\n      finally settled.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And rising as she thus spoke, she would have\\r\\n      quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the\\r\\n      subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than\\r\\n      you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of\\r\\n      cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established\\r\\n      custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and\\r\\n      perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as\\r\\n      would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\r\\n      character.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReally, Mr. Collins,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\n      puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to\\r\\n      you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my\\r\\n      refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that\\r\\n      your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My\\r\\n      reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to\\r\\n      me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the\\r\\n      establishment I can offer would be any other than highly\\r\\n      desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family\\r\\n      of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances\\r\\n      highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\n      consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is\\r\\n      by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be\\r\\n      made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all\\r\\n      likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable\\r\\n      qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not\\r\\n      serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it\\r\\n      to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the\\r\\n      usual practice of elegant females.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to\\r\\n      that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable\\r\\n      man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed\\r\\n      sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done\\r\\n      me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely\\r\\n      impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak\\r\\n      plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending\\r\\n      to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth\\r\\n      from her heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are uniformly charming!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he, with an air of awkward\\r\\n      gallantry; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the\\r\\n      express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals\\r\\n      will not fail of being acceptable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\\r\\n      make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew;\\r\\n      determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals\\r\\n      as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose\\r\\n      negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and\\r\\n      whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the\\r\\n      affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\n      successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\\r\\n      vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\\r\\n      Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the\\r\\n      staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated\\r\\n      both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their\\r\\n      nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these\\r\\n      felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate\\r\\n      the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he\\r\\n      trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal\\r\\n      which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\r\\n      from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her\\r\\n      character.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have\\r\\n      been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to\\r\\n      encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared\\r\\n      not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Lizzy shall\\r\\n      be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She\\r\\n      is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own\\r\\n      interest but I will _make_ her know it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPardon me for interrupting you, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Collins; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\n      if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she\\r\\n      would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\\r\\n      situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\\r\\n      state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\\r\\n      perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\\r\\n      because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\\r\\n      contribute much to my felicity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir, you quite misunderstand me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything\\r\\n      else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go\\r\\n      directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with\\r\\n      her, I am sure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\\r\\n      her husband, called out as she entered the library, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Mr.\\r\\n      Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You\\r\\n      must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\\r\\n      not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his\\r\\n      mind and not have _her_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\\r\\n      fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the\\r\\n      least altered by her communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, when she\\r\\n      had finished her speech. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf what are you talking?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have\\r\\n      Lizzy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless\\r\\n      business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon\\r\\n      her marrying him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\r\\n      library.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome here, child,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her father as she appeared. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\n      sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr.\\r\\n      Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Elizabeth\\r\\n      replied that it was. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well\\xe2\\x80\\x94and this offer of marriage you\\r\\n      have refused?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon\\r\\n      your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, or I will never see her again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day\\r\\n      you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will\\r\\n      never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will\\r\\n      never see you again if you _do_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\\r\\n      beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\\r\\n      husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\\r\\n      disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised\\r\\n      me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied her husband, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have two small favours to\\r\\n      request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my\\r\\n      understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.\\r\\n      I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\\r\\n      did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again\\r\\n      and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to\\r\\n      secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\\r\\n      mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\\r\\n      real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\\r\\n      her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination\\r\\n      never did.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\\r\\n      passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\\r\\n      motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\\r\\n      hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite\\r\\n      imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\r\\n\\r\\n      While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\\r\\n      spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\\r\\n      who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad you are\\r\\n      come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened\\r\\n      this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she\\r\\n      will not have him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\\r\\n      Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\\r\\n      entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she\\r\\n      likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\\r\\n      compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\\r\\n      comply with the wishes of all her family. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray do, my dear Miss\\r\\n      Lucas,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added in a melancholy tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor nobody is on my\\r\\n      side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels\\r\\n      for my poor nerves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, there she comes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clooking as\\r\\n      unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were\\r\\n      at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss\\r\\n      Lizzy\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer\\r\\n      of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\n      I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father\\r\\n      is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep you\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so I warn you. I\\r\\n      have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library,\\r\\n      you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will\\r\\n      find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to\\r\\n      undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in\\r\\n      talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous\\r\\n      complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can\\r\\n      tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not\\r\\n      complain are never pitied.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\r\\n      any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase\\r\\n      the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption\\r\\n      from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who\\r\\n      entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on\\r\\n      perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, I do insist upon\\r\\n      it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr.\\r\\n      Collins have a little conversation together.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\\r\\n      followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\\r\\n      could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, whose enquiries after herself and all her family were\\r\\n      very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself\\r\\n      with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a\\r\\n      doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\r\\n      Mr. Collins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet us be for ever silent on this\\r\\n      point. Far be it from me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he presently continued, in a voice\\r\\n      that marked his displeasure, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto resent the behaviour of your\\r\\n      daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all;\\r\\n      the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\\r\\n      have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps\\r\\n      not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had\\r\\n      my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often\\r\\n      observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the\\r\\n      blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\r\\n      estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\\r\\n      disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my\\r\\n      pretensions to your daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favour, without having paid\\r\\n      yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to\\r\\n      interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be\\r\\n      objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\\r\\n      daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to\\r\\n      error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My\\r\\n      object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\\r\\n      due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my\\r\\n      _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\\r\\n      apologise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n      The discussion of Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offer was now nearly at an end,\\r\\n      and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\n      necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish\\r\\n      allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_\\r\\n      feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or\\r\\n      dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner\\r\\n      and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\\r\\n      assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\\r\\n      were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\r\\n      civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all,\\r\\n      and especially to her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ill-humour or\\r\\n      ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry\\r\\n      pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his\\r\\n      visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.\\r\\n      He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant\\r\\n      to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the\\r\\n      Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and\\r\\n      attended them to their aunt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where his regret and vexation, and\\r\\n      the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth,\\r\\n      however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his\\r\\n      absence _had_ been self-imposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI found,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas the time drew near that I had better not\\r\\n      meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with\\r\\n      him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear,\\r\\n      and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\\r\\n      full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they\\r\\n      civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer\\r\\n      walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he\\r\\n      particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double\\r\\n      advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and\\r\\n      it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her\\r\\n      father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet;\\r\\n      it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of\\r\\n      elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s countenance\\r\\n      change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some\\r\\n      particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting\\r\\n      the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the\\r\\n      general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the\\r\\n      subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\\r\\n      sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from\\r\\n      Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained\\r\\n      their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me\\r\\n      a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time,\\r\\n      and are on their way to town\\xe2\\x80\\x94and without any intention of coming\\r\\n      back again. You shall hear what she says.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the\\r\\n      information of their having just resolved to follow their brother\\r\\n      to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor\\r\\n      Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we\\r\\n      will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\r\\n      delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\r\\n      lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\r\\n      unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To these\\r\\n      highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the\\r\\n      insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their\\r\\n      removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it\\r\\n      was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would\\r\\n      prevent Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being there; and as to the loss of their\\r\\n      society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in\\r\\n      the enjoyment of his.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is unlucky,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, after a short pause, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you should\\r\\n      not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\r\\n      But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which\\r\\n      Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware,\\r\\n      and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends\\r\\n      will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\r\\n      Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business\\r\\n      which took him to London might be concluded in three or four\\r\\n      days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time\\r\\n      convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry\\r\\n      to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither,\\r\\n      that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a\\r\\n      comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for\\r\\n      the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend,\\r\\n      had any intention of making one of the crowd\\xe2\\x80\\x94but of that I\\r\\n      despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may\\r\\n      abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and\\r\\n      that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling\\r\\n      the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is evident by this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat he comes back no more\\r\\n      this winter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\\r\\n      _should_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own\\r\\n      master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage\\r\\n      which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the\\r\\n      truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really\\r\\n      do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,\\r\\n      and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and\\r\\n      myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from\\r\\n      the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I\\r\\n      do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on\\r\\n      this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding\\r\\n      them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My\\r\\n      brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent\\r\\n      opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\\r\\n      relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a\\r\\n      sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call\\r\\n      Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart. With all\\r\\n      these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to\\r\\n      prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of\\r\\n      an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane\\r\\n      as she finished it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it not clear enough? Does it not\\r\\n      expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to\\r\\n      be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings\\r\\n      for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can\\r\\n      there be any other opinion on the subject?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear\\r\\n      it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost willingly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her\\r\\n      brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\r\\n      She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries\\r\\n      to persuade you that he does not care about you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen\\r\\n      you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure,\\r\\n      cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as\\r\\n      much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her\\r\\n      wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or\\r\\n      grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss\\r\\n      Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been\\r\\n      _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a\\r\\n      second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare\\r\\n      say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\\r\\n      my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss\\r\\n      Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is\\r\\n      in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he\\r\\n      took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to\\r\\n      persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very\\r\\n      much in love with her friend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyour\\r\\n      representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know\\r\\n      the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully\\r\\n      deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that\\r\\n      she is deceiving herself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is right. You could not have started a more happy idea,\\r\\n      since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be\\r\\n      deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and\\r\\n      must fret no longer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\r\\n      accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to\\r\\n      marry elsewhere?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must decide for yourself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand if, upon\\r\\n      mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his\\r\\n      two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his\\r\\n      wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can you talk so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane, faintly smiling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must know\\r\\n      that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their\\r\\n      disapprobation, I could not hesitate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot\\r\\n      consider your situation with much compassion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\r\\n      required. A thousand things may arise in six months!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the\\r\\n      utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of\\r\\n      Caroline\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment\\r\\n      suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,\\r\\n      could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she\\r\\n      felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its\\r\\n      happy effect. Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s temper was not desponding, and she was\\r\\n      gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\\r\\n      sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\\r\\n      Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of\\r\\n      the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great\\r\\n      deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that\\r\\n      the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting\\r\\n      so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some\\r\\n      length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon\\r\\n      down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of\\r\\n      all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been\\r\\n      invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two\\r\\n      full courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again\\r\\n      during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen\\r\\n      to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt keeps him in good humour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I am more obliged\\r\\n      to you than I can express.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Charlotte assured her friend of her\\r\\n      satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for\\r\\n      the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but\\r\\n      Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any\\r\\n      conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\r\\n      from any return of Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s addresses, by engaging them\\r\\n      towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scheme; and appearances\\r\\n      were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would\\r\\n      have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave\\r\\n      Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the\\r\\n      fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape\\r\\n      out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness,\\r\\n      and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was\\r\\n      anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction\\r\\n      that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture\\r\\n      his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till\\r\\n      its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\\r\\n      secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably\\r\\n      encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure\\r\\n      of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering\\r\\n      kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked\\r\\n      towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally\\r\\n      in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love\\r\\n      and eloquence awaited her there.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In as short a time as Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long speeches would allow,\\r\\n      everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;\\r\\n      and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name\\r\\n      the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such\\r\\n      a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no\\r\\n      inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with\\r\\n      which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any\\r\\n      charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss\\r\\n      Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested\\r\\n      desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment\\r\\n      were gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their\\r\\n      consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr.\\r\\n      Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for\\r\\n      their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his\\r\\n      prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas\\r\\n      began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter\\r\\n      had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was\\r\\n      likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion,\\r\\n      that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\r\\n      Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\\r\\n      his wife should make their appearance at St. James\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. The whole\\r\\n      family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The\\r\\n      younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner\\r\\n      than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\\r\\n      from their apprehension of Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dying an old maid.\\r\\n      Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her\\r\\n      point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in\\r\\n      general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither\\r\\n      sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\\r\\n      attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her\\r\\n      husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\\r\\n      marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\\r\\n      for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however\\r\\n      uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\r\\n      preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained;\\r\\n      and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been\\r\\n      handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable\\r\\n      circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to\\r\\n      Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any\\r\\n      other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame\\r\\n      her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings\\r\\n      must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her\\r\\n      the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when\\r\\n      he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\r\\n      passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of\\r\\n      course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without\\r\\n      difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst\\r\\n      forth in such very direct questions on his return as required\\r\\n      some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising\\r\\n      great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous\\r\\n      love.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any\\r\\n      of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when\\r\\n      the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great\\r\\n      politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see\\r\\n      him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him\\r\\n      to visit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis invitation is particularly\\r\\n      gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\r\\n      you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon\\r\\n      as possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means\\r\\n      wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disapprobation here,\\r\\n      my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the\\r\\n      risk of offending your patroness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Collins, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am particularly obliged to\\r\\n      you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not\\r\\n      taking so material a step without her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concurrence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather\\r\\n      than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by\\r\\n      your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly\\r\\n      probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall\\r\\n      take no offence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBelieve me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\r\\n      affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily\\r\\n      receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other\\r\\n      mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my\\r\\n      fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render\\r\\n      it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health\\r\\n      and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them\\r\\n      equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his\\r\\n      addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been\\r\\n      prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher\\r\\n      than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections\\r\\n      which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as\\r\\n      herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve\\r\\n      himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\r\\n      agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of\\r\\n      this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast,\\r\\n      and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of\\r\\n      the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The possibility of Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fancying himself in love with\\r\\n      her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or\\r\\n      two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far\\r\\n      from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her\\r\\n      astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first\\r\\n      the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEngaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x94impossible!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling\\r\\n      her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so\\r\\n      direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected,\\r\\n      she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it\\r\\n      incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with\\r\\n      you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong\\r\\n      effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that\\r\\n      the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her,\\r\\n      and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see what you are feeling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Charlotte. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must be\\r\\n      surprised, very much surprised\\xe2\\x80\\x94so lately as Mr. Collins was\\r\\n      wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it\\r\\n      over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am\\r\\n      not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable\\r\\n      home; and considering Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character, connection, and\\r\\n      situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness\\r\\n      with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the\\r\\n      marriage state.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth quietly answered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and after an awkward\\r\\n      pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not\\r\\n      stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what\\r\\n      she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all\\r\\n      reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness\\r\\n      of Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making two offers of marriage within three days\\r\\n      was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had\\r\\n      always felt that Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion of matrimony was not exactly\\r\\n      like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,\\r\\n      when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\r\\n      feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins\\r\\n      was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend\\r\\n      disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the\\r\\n      distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to\\r\\n      be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\\r\\n      what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\\r\\n      mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\\r\\n      daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many\\r\\n      compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of\\r\\n      a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter\\xe2\\x80\\x94to an\\r\\n      audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be\\r\\n      entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil,\\r\\n      boisterously exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not\\r\\n      you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\r\\n      without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good breeding\\r\\n      carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be\\r\\n      positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all\\r\\n      their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\\r\\n      unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\\r\\n      account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\\r\\n      herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\\r\\n      mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\\r\\n      Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\\r\\n      making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\\r\\n      expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\\r\\n      and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal\\r\\n      while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than\\r\\n      her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she\\r\\n      persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\\r\\n      was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\\r\\n      trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\\r\\n      that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were\\r\\n      plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real\\r\\n      cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been\\r\\n      barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she\\r\\n      principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\\r\\n      console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out\\r\\n      her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth\\r\\n      without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak\\r\\n      to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months\\r\\n      were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,\\r\\n      and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most\\r\\n      agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that\\r\\n      Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\\r\\n      sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\\r\\n      daughter!\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she\\r\\n      said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for\\r\\n      their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it\\r\\n      as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\\r\\n      for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\\r\\n      other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\\r\\n      retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\\r\\n      married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to\\r\\n      say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sour looks and\\r\\n      ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\\r\\n      away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept\\r\\n      them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded\\r\\n      that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.\\r\\n      Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard\\r\\n      to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her\\r\\n      opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew\\r\\n      daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and\\r\\n      nothing more was heard of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\\r\\n      counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\r\\n      The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\\r\\n      Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\\r\\n      solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abode in the family\\r\\n      might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that\\r\\n      head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\\r\\n      expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\\r\\n      their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\\r\\n      was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been\\r\\n      so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\\r\\n      Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\\r\\n      fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his\\r\\n      marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\\r\\n      which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\\r\\n      amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\\r\\n      happiest of men.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\r\\n      pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much\\r\\n      disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange\\r\\n      that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\\r\\n      was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated\\r\\n      having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent,\\r\\n      and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were\\r\\n      the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the\\r\\n      greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continued absence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day\\r\\n      after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him\\r\\n      than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming\\r\\n      no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly\\r\\n      incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as\\r\\n      a most scandalous falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Even Elizabeth began to fear\\xe2\\x80\\x94not that Bingley was indifferent\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\r\\n      that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\r\\n      Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\\r\\n      could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of\\r\\n      his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend,\\r\\n      assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of\\r\\n      London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his\\r\\n      attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\\r\\n      more painful than Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, but whatever she felt she was\\r\\n      desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\\r\\n      therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such\\r\\n      delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\\r\\n      she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his\\r\\n      arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come\\r\\n      back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\\r\\n      tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\\r\\n      reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been\\r\\n      on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need\\r\\n      much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of\\r\\n      love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The\\r\\n      chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\\r\\n      sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology\\r\\n      for his absence before the family went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention\\r\\n      of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of\\r\\n      ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it\\r\\n      talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her\\r\\n      successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous\\r\\n      abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded\\r\\n      her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she\\r\\n      spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were\\r\\n      talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\\r\\n      and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were\\r\\n      dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is very hard to think that\\r\\n      Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_\\r\\n      should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take\\r\\n      her place in it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope\\r\\n      for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the\\r\\n      survivor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,\\r\\n      instead of making any answer, she went on as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If\\r\\n      it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat should not you mind?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should not mind anything at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\r\\n      insensibility.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\\r\\n      entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\\r\\n      estate from one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for\\r\\n      the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he_ have it more than\\r\\n      anybody else?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI leave it to yourself to determine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very\\r\\n      first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled\\r\\n      in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regret\\r\\n      at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire before he left the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\\r\\n      rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed\\r\\n      affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss\\r\\n      Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions\\r\\n      were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their\\r\\n      increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment\\r\\n      of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She\\r\\n      wrote also with great pleasure of her brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being an inmate\\r\\n      of Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\\r\\n      the latter with regard to new furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all\\r\\n      this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided\\r\\n      between concern for her sister, and resentment against all\\r\\n      others. To Caroline\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertion of her brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being partial to\\r\\n      Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane,\\r\\n      she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\\r\\n      always been disposed to like him, she could not think without\\r\\n      anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\\r\\n      want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\\r\\n      designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\r\\n      to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness,\\r\\n      however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\\r\\n      sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her\\r\\n      sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible\\r\\n      himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be\\r\\n      long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing\\r\\n      else; and yet whether Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regard had really died away, or\\r\\n      were suppressed by his friends\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interference; whether he had been\\r\\n      aware of Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\r\\n      observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\\r\\n      must be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\\r\\n      feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaving them\\r\\n      together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\\r\\n      and its master, she could not help saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can\\r\\n      have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\\r\\n      reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long.\\r\\n      He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\\r\\n      said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou doubt me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Jane, slightly colouring; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindeed, you have\\r\\n      no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\\r\\n      acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or\\r\\n      fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not\\r\\n      _that_ pain. A little time, therefore\\xe2\\x80\\x94I shall certainly try to\\r\\n      get the better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      With a stronger voice she soon added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have this comfort\\r\\n      immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\\r\\n      my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Jane!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are too good. Your\\r\\n      sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\\r\\n      what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\\r\\n      loved you as you deserve.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw\\r\\n      back the praise on her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s warm affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is not fair. _You_ wish to think all\\r\\n      the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.\\r\\n      _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself\\r\\n      against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my\\r\\n      encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need\\r\\n      not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of\\r\\n      whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I\\r\\n      dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the\\r\\n      inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little\\r\\n      dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\r\\n      sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not\\r\\n      mention; the other is Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marriage. It is unaccountable!\\r\\n      In every view it is unaccountable!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They\\r\\n      will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for\\r\\n      difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      respectability, and Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steady, prudent character.\\r\\n      Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune,\\r\\n      it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for\\r\\n      everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, that she may feel something like regard and\\r\\n      esteem for our cousin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\\r\\n      one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\\r\\n      persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\\r\\n      think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My\\r\\n      dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,\\r\\n      silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as\\r\\n      well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper\\r\\n      way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte\\r\\n      Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the\\r\\n      meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\\r\\n      yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility\\r\\n      of danger security for happiness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      replied Jane; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\\r\\n      them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something\\r\\n      else. You mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you,\\r\\n      but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that\\r\\n      person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must\\r\\n      not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must\\r\\n      not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and\\r\\n      circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that\\r\\n      deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd men take care that they should.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have\\r\\n      no idea of there being so much design in the world as some\\r\\n      persons imagine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conduct to\\r\\n      design,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut without scheming to do wrong, or to\\r\\n      make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.\\r\\n      Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings,\\r\\n      and want of resolution, will do the business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd do you impute it to either of those?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by\\r\\n      saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you\\r\\n      can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, in conjunction with his friend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They\\r\\n      can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no\\r\\n      other woman can secure it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour first position is false. They may wish many things besides\\r\\n      his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\\r\\n      consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\\r\\n      importance of money, great connections, and pride.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\n      Jane; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut this may be from better feelings than you are\\r\\n      supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known\\r\\n      me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their\\r\\n      own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their\\r\\n      brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it,\\r\\n      unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed\\r\\n      him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so,\\r\\n      they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make\\r\\n      everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do\\r\\n      not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\\r\\n      mistaken\\xe2\\x80\\x94or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison\\r\\n      of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let\\r\\n      me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be\\r\\n      understood.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\\r\\n      no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\\r\\n      not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\\r\\n      considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to\\r\\n      convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\\r\\n      attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\\r\\n      transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\\r\\n      though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\\r\\n      she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best\\r\\n      comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, Lizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he\\r\\n      one day, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyour sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate\\r\\n      her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little\\r\\n      in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives\\r\\n      her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn\\r\\n      to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is\\r\\n      your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\\r\\n      the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a\\r\\n      pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We\\r\\n      must not all expect Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good fortune.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it is a comfort to think that\\r\\n      whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\\r\\n      mother who will make the most of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s society was of material service in dispelling the\\r\\n      gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of\\r\\n      the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other\\r\\n      recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The\\r\\n      whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly\\r\\n      acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to\\r\\n      know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had\\r\\n      known anything of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might\\r\\n      be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the\\r\\n      society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\\r\\n      pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\r\\n      by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 25\\r\\n\\r\\n      After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of\\r\\n      felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by\\r\\n      the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might\\r\\n      be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of\\r\\n      his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his\\r\\n      return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to\\r\\n      make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at\\r\\n      Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair\\r\\n      cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\\r\\n      another letter of thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\\r\\n      receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend\\r\\n      the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,\\r\\n      gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by\\r\\n      nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had\\r\\n      difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within\\r\\n      view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and\\r\\n      agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\\r\\n      woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.\\r\\n      Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a\\r\\n      particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in\\r\\n      town.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business on her arrival was to\\r\\n      distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When\\r\\n      this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her\\r\\n      turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and\\r\\n      much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she\\r\\n      last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of\\r\\n      marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not blame Jane,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor Jane would have got\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard\\r\\n      to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife by this\\r\\n      time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an\\r\\n      offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of\\r\\n      it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I\\r\\n      have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as\\r\\n      ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are\\r\\n      all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so\\r\\n      it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in\\r\\n      my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\\r\\n      before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is\\r\\n      the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you\\r\\n      tell us, of long sleeves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given\\r\\n      before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s correspondence with\\r\\n      her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her\\r\\n      nieces, turned the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the\\r\\n      subject. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems likely to have been a desirable match for\\r\\n      Jane,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry it went off. But these things happen\\r\\n      so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so\\r\\n      easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when\\r\\n      accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort\\r\\n      of inconsistencies are very frequent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn excellent consolation in its way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it\\r\\n      will not do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not\\r\\n      often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a\\r\\n      young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom\\r\\n      he was violently in love with only a few days before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut that expression of \\xe2\\x80\\x98violently in love\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is so hackneyed, so\\r\\n      doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is\\r\\n      as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent\\r\\n      was_ Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\r\\n      inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every\\r\\n      time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own\\r\\n      ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to\\r\\n      dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an\\r\\n      answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility\\r\\n      the very essence of love?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x94of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\r\\n      Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she\\r\\n      may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to\\r\\n      _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\r\\n      But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?\\r\\n      Change of scene might be of service\\xe2\\x80\\x94and perhaps a little relief\\r\\n      from home may be as useful as anything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt\\r\\n      persuaded of her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ready acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Mrs. Gardiner, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat no consideration with regard\\r\\n      to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a\\r\\n      part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you\\r\\n      well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that\\r\\n      they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of\\r\\n      his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on\\r\\n      Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think\\r\\n      of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as\\r\\n      Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ablution\\r\\n      enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter\\r\\n      it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does\\r\\n      not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to\\r\\n      help calling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe will drop the acquaintance entirely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to\\r\\n      place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of\\r\\n      Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude\\r\\n      on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did\\r\\n      not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes\\r\\n      she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated,\\r\\n      and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the\\r\\n      more natural influence of Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet accepted her aunt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invitation with pleasure; and the\\r\\n      Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than\\r\\n      as she hoped by Caroline\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not living in the same house with her\\r\\n      brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without\\r\\n      any danger of seeing him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\\r\\n      Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day\\r\\n      without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for\\r\\n      the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not\\r\\n      once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for\\r\\n      home, some of the officers always made part of it\\xe2\\x80\\x94of which\\r\\n      officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s warm\\r\\n      commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\\r\\n      them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their\\r\\n      preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little\\r\\n      uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject\\r\\n      before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the\\r\\n      imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\\r\\n      unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years\\r\\n      ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in\\r\\n      that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had,\\r\\n      therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had\\r\\n      been little there since the death of Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, it was yet\\r\\n      in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former\\r\\n      friends than she had been in the way of procuring.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\\r\\n      character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible\\r\\n      subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley\\r\\n      with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in\\r\\n      bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late\\r\\n      possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made\\r\\n      acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treatment of him, she\\r\\n      tried to remember some of that gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reputed disposition\\r\\n      when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at\\r\\n      last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy\\r\\n      formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 26\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\\r\\n      given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her\\r\\n      alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went\\r\\n      on:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely\\r\\n      because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not\\r\\n      afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your\\r\\n      guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an\\r\\n      affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.\\r\\n      I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting\\r\\n      young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should\\r\\n      think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let\\r\\n      your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect\\r\\n      you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\\r\\n      good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\\r\\n      myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me,\\r\\n      if I can prevent it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cElizabeth, you are not serious now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love\\r\\n      with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all\\r\\n      comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw\\xe2\\x80\\x94and if he becomes\\r\\n      really attached to me\\xe2\\x80\\x94I believe it will be better that he should\\r\\n      not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!\\r\\n      My father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I\\r\\n      should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial\\r\\n      to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to\\r\\n      be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every\\r\\n      day that where there is affection, young people are seldom\\r\\n      withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into\\r\\n      engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than\\r\\n      so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even\\r\\n      to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise\\r\\n      you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry\\r\\n      to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with\\r\\n      him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so\\r\\n      very often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of\\r\\n      inviting him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I did the other day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do\\r\\n      not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your\\r\\n      account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You\\r\\n      know my mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas as to the necessity of constant company\\r\\n      for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do\\r\\n      what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\\r\\n      her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful\\r\\n      instance of advice being given on such a point, without being\\r\\n      resented.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been\\r\\n      quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode\\r\\n      with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at\\r\\n      length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even\\r\\n      repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_wished_\\r\\n      they might be happy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on\\r\\n      Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose\\r\\n      to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ungracious and\\r\\n      reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,\\r\\n      accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs\\r\\n      together, Charlotte said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_That_ you certainly shall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me,\\r\\n      therefore, to come to Hunsford.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in\\r\\n      the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy father and Maria are coming to me in March,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Charlotte,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza,\\r\\n      you will be as welcome as either of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent\\r\\n      from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to\\r\\n      hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her\\r\\n      friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as\\r\\n      it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was\\r\\n      impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling\\r\\n      that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined\\r\\n      not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what\\r\\n      had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first letters were\\r\\n      received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\r\\n      curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she\\r\\n      would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce\\r\\n      herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt\\r\\n      that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she\\r\\n      might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with\\r\\n      comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The\\r\\n      house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her\\r\\n      taste, and Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behaviour was most friendly and\\r\\n      obliging. It was Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s picture of Hunsford and Rosings\\r\\n      rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\\r\\n      for her own visit there to know the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce\\r\\n      their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth\\r\\n      hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as\\r\\n      impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without\\r\\n      either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it,\\r\\n      however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from\\r\\n      Longbourn had by some accident been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy aunt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis going to-morrow into that part of\\r\\n      the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in\\r\\n      Grosvenor Street.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\\r\\n      Bingley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not think Caroline in spirits,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were her words,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving\\r\\n      her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my\\r\\n      last letter had never reached her. I enquired after their\\r\\n      brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy\\r\\n      was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not\\r\\n      long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I\\r\\n      shall see them soon here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\\r\\n      accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being in\\r\\n      town.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She\\r\\n      endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but\\r\\n      she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inattention. After\\r\\n      waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing\\r\\n      every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last\\r\\n      appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the\\r\\n      alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\\r\\n      longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister\\r\\n      will prove what she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\r\\n      her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to\\r\\n      have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regard for me. But,\\r\\n      my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not\\r\\n      think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her\\r\\n      behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I\\r\\n      do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate\\r\\n      with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am\\r\\n      sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit\\r\\n      till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the\\r\\n      meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no\\r\\n      pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\r\\n      calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and\\r\\n      was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went\\r\\n      away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no\\r\\n      longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very\\r\\n      wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every\\r\\n      advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because\\r\\n      she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\\r\\n      very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need\\r\\n      not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to\\r\\n      be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account\\r\\n      for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his\\r\\n      sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural\\r\\n      and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such\\r\\n      fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have\\r\\n      met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from\\r\\n      something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner\\r\\n      of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is\\r\\n      really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were\\r\\n      not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say\\r\\n      that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I\\r\\n      will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of\\r\\n      what will make me happy\\xe2\\x80\\x94your affection, and the invariable\\r\\n      kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\\r\\n      soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to\\r\\n      Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any\\r\\n      certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that\\r\\n      you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.\\r\\n      Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you\\r\\n      will be very comfortable there.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Yours, etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\\r\\n      she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister\\r\\n      at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely\\r\\n      over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\r\\n      His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for\\r\\n      him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped\\r\\n      he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sister, as by Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown\\r\\n      away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\r\\n      concerning that gentleman, and required information; and\\r\\n      Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to\\r\\n      her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided,\\r\\n      his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\r\\n      Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it\\r\\n      and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but\\r\\n      slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing\\r\\n      that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted\\r\\n      it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\\r\\n      remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering\\r\\n      himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in\\r\\n      this case than in Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, did not quarrel with him for his\\r\\n      wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more\\r\\n      natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few\\r\\n      struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and\\r\\n      desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\\r\\n      happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating\\r\\n      the circumstances, she thus went on: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am now convinced, my dear\\r\\n      aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really\\r\\n      experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present\\r\\n      detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my\\r\\n      feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even\\r\\n      impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at\\r\\n      all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good\\r\\n      sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness\\r\\n      has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\r\\n      interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in\\r\\n      love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative\\r\\n      insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.\\r\\n      Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.\\r\\n      They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the\\r\\n      mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something\\r\\n      to live on as well as the plain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 27\\r\\n\\r\\n      With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and\\r\\n      otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,\\r\\n      sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass\\r\\n      away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at\\r\\n      first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she\\r\\n      soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned\\r\\n      to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater\\r\\n      certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte\\r\\n      again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty\\r\\n      in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\r\\n      uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little\\r\\n      change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would\\r\\n      moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew\\r\\n      near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,\\r\\n      however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to\\r\\n      Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and\\r\\n      his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in\\r\\n      London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan\\r\\n      could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss\\r\\n      her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her\\r\\n      going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to\\r\\n      answer her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\\r\\n      friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not\\r\\n      make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and\\r\\n      to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the\\r\\n      first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu,\\r\\n      wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to\\r\\n      expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of\\r\\n      her\\xe2\\x80\\x94their opinion of everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x94would always coincide, there was a\\r\\n      solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to\\r\\n      him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced\\r\\n      that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of\\r\\n      the amiable and pleasing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\r\\n      think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter\\r\\n      Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had\\r\\n      nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to\\r\\n      with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth\\r\\n      loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too long. He\\r\\n      could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and\\r\\n      knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his\\r\\n      information.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\\r\\n      early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching\\r\\n      their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to\\r\\n      welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was\\r\\n      pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs\\r\\n      were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their\\r\\n      cousin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance would not allow them to wait in the\\r\\n      drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a\\r\\n      twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\\r\\n      kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in\\r\\n      bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object\\r\\n      was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear,\\r\\n      in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always\\r\\n      struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of\\r\\n      dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would\\r\\n      not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of\\r\\n      Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated\\r\\n      conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\\r\\n      herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given\\r\\n      up the acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desertion, and\\r\\n      complimented her on bearing it so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut my dear Elizabeth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat sort of girl is Miss\\r\\n      King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\\r\\n      affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does\\r\\n      discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid\\r\\n      of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now,\\r\\n      because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds,\\r\\n      you want to find out that he is mercenary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall\\r\\n      know what to think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of\\r\\n      her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut he paid her not the smallest attention till her\\r\\n      grandfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death made her mistress of this fortune.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo\\xe2\\x80\\x94why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\\r\\n      affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be\\r\\n      for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was\\r\\n      equally poor?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\\r\\n      towards her so soon after this event.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those\\r\\n      elegant decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does\\r\\n      not object to it, why should _we_?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her\\r\\n      being deficient in something herself\\xe2\\x80\\x94sense or feeling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave it as you choose. _He_ shall be\\r\\n      mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry,\\r\\n      you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in\\r\\n      Derbyshire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\\r\\n      live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank\\r\\n      Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not\\r\\n      one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to\\r\\n      recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after\\r\\n      all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\\r\\n      disappointment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had\\r\\n      the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle\\r\\n      and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the\\r\\n      summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have not determined how far it shall carry us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut, perhaps, to the Lakes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\\r\\n      acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, my\\r\\n      dear, dear aunt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she rapturously cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat delight! what\\r\\n      felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to\\r\\n      disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and\\r\\n      mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when\\r\\n      we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\r\\n      being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know\\r\\n      where we have gone\\xe2\\x80\\x94we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes,\\r\\n      mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our\\r\\n      imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular\\r\\n      scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let\\r\\n      _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the\\r\\n      generality of travellers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 28\\r\\n\\r\\n      Every object in the next day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s journey was new and interesting to\\r\\n      Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she\\r\\n      had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her\\r\\n      health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant\\r\\n      source of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\\r\\n      was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to\\r\\n      bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary\\r\\n      on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she\\r\\n      had heard of its inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to\\r\\n      the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the\\r\\n      laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins\\r\\n      and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at\\r\\n      the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house,\\r\\n      amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they\\r\\n      were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.\\r\\n      Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and\\r\\n      Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found\\r\\n      herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her\\r\\n      cousin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal\\r\\n      civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\r\\n      minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all\\r\\n      her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing\\r\\n      out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as\\r\\n      soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time,\\r\\n      with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually\\r\\n      repeated all his wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offers of refreshment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\\r\\n      help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the\\r\\n      room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself\\r\\n      particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had\\r\\n      lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and\\r\\n      comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of\\r\\n      repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she\\r\\n      could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.\\r\\n      Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\r\\n      ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily\\r\\n      turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a\\r\\n      faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After\\r\\n      sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the\\r\\n      room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of\\r\\n      their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\r\\n      Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was\\r\\n      large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he\\r\\n      attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\\r\\n      respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\\r\\n      countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of\\r\\n      the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\r\\n      Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and\\r\\n      scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked\\r\\n      for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\\r\\n      beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every\\r\\n      direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most\\r\\n      distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\\r\\n      the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\\r\\n      the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\\r\\n      bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was\\r\\n      a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n      From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\\r\\n      meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the\\r\\n      remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William\\r\\n      accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\\r\\n      house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\\r\\n      of showing it without her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help. It was rather small,\\r\\n      but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and\\r\\n      arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave\\r\\n      Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten,\\r\\n      there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\\r\\n      Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must\\r\\n      be often forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the\\r\\n      country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when\\r\\n      Mr. Collins joining in, observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\\r\\n      Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need\\r\\n      not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and\\r\\n      condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some\\r\\n      portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any\\r\\n      hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in\\r\\n      every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.\\r\\n      Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at\\r\\n      Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her\\r\\n      ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I _should_ say,\\r\\n      one of her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s carriages, for she has several.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      added Charlotte, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand a most attentive neighbour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort\\r\\n      of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\\r\\n      and telling again what had already been written; and when it\\r\\n      closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to\\r\\n      meditate upon Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree of contentment, to understand\\r\\n      her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her\\r\\n      husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She\\r\\n      had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor\\r\\n      of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A\\r\\n      lively imagination soon settled it all.\\r\\n\\r\\n      About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\\r\\n      ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole\\r\\n      house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard\\r\\n      somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly\\r\\n      after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing\\r\\n      place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\\r\\n      dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not\\r\\n      tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\\r\\n      more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the\\r\\n      lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a\\r\\n      low phaeton at the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd is this all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI expected at least that the\\r\\n      pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady\\r\\n      Catherine and her daughter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa! my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is\\r\\n      not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives\\r\\n      with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is\\r\\n      quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be\\r\\n      so thin and small?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all\\r\\n      this wind. Why does she not come in?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of\\r\\n      favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like her appearance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well.\\r\\n      She will make him a very proper wife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\\r\\n      conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest\\r\\n      contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing\\r\\n      whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\\r\\n      and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw\\r\\n      the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good\\r\\n      fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the\\r\\n      whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 29\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\\r\\n      complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\\r\\n      to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\\r\\n      towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for;\\r\\n      and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was\\r\\n      such an instance of Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s condescension, as he knew\\r\\n      not how to admire enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI confess,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I should not have been at all\\r\\n      surprised by her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and\\r\\n      spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my\\r\\n      knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could\\r\\n      have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined\\r\\n      that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an\\r\\n      invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately\\r\\n      after your arrival!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the less surprised at what has happened,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Sir\\r\\n      William, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom that knowledge of what the manners of the great\\r\\n      really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\r\\n      About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\\r\\n      uncommon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but\\r\\n      their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\\r\\n      them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\\r\\n      so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\\r\\n      overpower them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.\\r\\n      Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us\\r\\n      which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely\\r\\n      to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest\\xe2\\x80\\x94there\\r\\n      is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think\\r\\n      the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the\\r\\n      distinction of rank preserved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\\r\\n      different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\\r\\n      Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\r\\n      Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\\r\\n      living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\\r\\n      company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\\r\\n      with as much apprehension as her father had done to his\\r\\n      presentation at St. James\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\r\\n      mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its\\r\\n      prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she\\r\\n      could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene\\r\\n      to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of\\r\\n      the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\\r\\n      glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alarm was every\\r\\n      moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly\\r\\n      calm. Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing\\r\\n      of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary\\r\\n      talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money\\r\\n      or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\r\\n      rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\\r\\n      they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\\r\\n      where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\\r\\n      sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\\r\\n      them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that\\r\\n      the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\\r\\n      proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he\\r\\n      would have thought necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In spite of having been at St. James\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Sir William was so\\r\\n      completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but\\r\\n      just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat\\r\\n      without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of\\r\\n      her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way\\r\\n      to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and\\r\\n      could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady\\r\\n      Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,\\r\\n      which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\\r\\n      conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to\\r\\n      make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not\\r\\n      rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken\\r\\n      in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and\\r\\n      brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind; and from the\\r\\n      observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to\\r\\n      be exactly what he represented.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\\r\\n      deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she\\r\\n      turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in\\r\\n      Maria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was\\r\\n      neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss\\r\\n      de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain,\\r\\n      were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low\\r\\n      voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing\\r\\n      remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she\\r\\n      said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her\\r\\n      eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\\r\\n      windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point\\r\\n      out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that\\r\\n      it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\\r\\n      servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\\r\\n      promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\\r\\n      the bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire, and looked as\\r\\n      if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,\\r\\n      and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\\r\\n      commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\\r\\n      enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\r\\n      manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But\\r\\n      Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,\\r\\n      and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the\\r\\n      table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much\\r\\n      conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an\\r\\n      opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de\\r\\n      Bourgh\\xe2\\x80\\x94the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady\\r\\n      Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.\\r\\n      Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss\\r\\n      de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\\r\\n      she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\\r\\n      and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\\r\\n      be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without\\r\\n      any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on\\r\\n      every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not\\r\\n      used to have her judgement controverted. She enquired into\\r\\n      Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a\\r\\n      great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her\\r\\n      how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as\\r\\n      hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her\\r\\n      poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great\\r\\n      lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of\\r\\n      dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.\\r\\n      Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\\r\\n      Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she\\r\\n      knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very\\r\\n      genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times,\\r\\n      how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than\\r\\n      herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether\\r\\n      they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage\\r\\n      her father kept, and what had been her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maiden name?\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered\\r\\n      them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For\\r\\n      your sake,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d turning to Charlotte, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad of it; but otherwise\\r\\n      I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It\\r\\n      was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family. Do you\\r\\n      play and sing, Miss Bennet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA little.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! then\\xe2\\x80\\x94some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\\r\\n      instrument is a capital one, probably superior to\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94You shall try\\r\\n      it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of them does.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The\\r\\n      Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\\r\\n      as yours. Do you draw?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, not at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat, none of you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your\\r\\n      mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit\\r\\n      of masters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\\r\\n      London.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas your governess left you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe never had any governess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up\\r\\n      at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your\\r\\n      mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\\r\\n      not been the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess,\\r\\n      you must have been neglected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCompared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\\r\\n      as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always\\r\\n      encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\r\\n      Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if\\r\\n      I had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\r\\n      strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be\\r\\n      done in education without steady and regular instruction, and\\r\\n      nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many\\r\\n      families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am\\r\\n      always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of\\r\\n      Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means;\\r\\n      and it was but the other day that I recommended another young\\r\\n      person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the\\r\\n      family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you\\r\\n      of Lady Metcalf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss\\r\\n      Pope a treasure. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lady Catherine,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x98you have given me a\\r\\n      treasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am, all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the\\r\\n      second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!\\r\\n      Your younger sisters must be very young?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to\\r\\n      be much in company. But really, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am, I think it would be very\\r\\n      hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share\\r\\n      of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the\\r\\n      means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a\\r\\n      right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back\\r\\n      on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to\\r\\n      promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her ladyship, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou give your opinion very\\r\\n      decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith three younger sisters grown up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n      smiling, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyour ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\\r\\n      answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\\r\\n      who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\\r\\n      not conceal your age.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not one-and-twenty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\\r\\n      card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and\\r\\n      Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose\\r\\n      to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting\\r\\n      Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was\\r\\n      superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did\\r\\n      not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\\r\\n      fears of Miss de Bourgh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being too hot or too cold, or having\\r\\n      too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\\r\\n      other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking\\xe2\\x80\\x94stating the\\r\\n      mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\\r\\n      herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her\\r\\n      ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\\r\\n      apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not\\r\\n      say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\\r\\n      names.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they\\r\\n      chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to\\r\\n      Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The\\r\\n      party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\\r\\n      determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From\\r\\n      these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the\\r\\n      coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      side and as many bows on Sir William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s they departed. As soon as\\r\\n      they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\\r\\n      cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings,\\r\\n      which, for Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, she made more favourable than it\\r\\n      really was. But her commendation, though costing her some\\r\\n      trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very\\r\\n      soon obliged to take her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s praise into his own hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 30\\r\\n\\r\\n      Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was\\r\\n      long enough to convince him of his daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being most\\r\\n      comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\\r\\n      such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William\\r\\n      was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out\\r\\n      in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away,\\r\\n      the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\\r\\n      Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\r\\n      cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between\\r\\n      breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the\\r\\n      garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window\\r\\n      in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which\\r\\n      the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather\\r\\n      wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for\\r\\n      common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant\\r\\n      aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason\\r\\n      for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\\r\\n      much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally\\r\\n      lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n      From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,\\r\\n      and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what\\r\\n      carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh\\r\\n      drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform\\r\\n      them of, though it happened almost every day. She not\\r\\n      unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n      conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon\\r\\n      to get out.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\\r\\n      Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\\r\\n      necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that\\r\\n      there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could\\r\\n      not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they\\r\\n      were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped\\r\\n      her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.\\r\\n      She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and\\r\\n      advised them to do it differently; found fault with the\\r\\n      arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in\\r\\n      negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it\\r\\n      only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s joints of\\r\\n      meat were too large for her family.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\r\\n      the commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active\\r\\n      magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were\\r\\n      carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers\\r\\n      were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she\\r\\n      sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,\\r\\n      silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a\\r\\n      week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being\\r\\n      only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was\\r\\n      the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few,\\r\\n      as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond\\r\\n      Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and\\r\\n      upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were\\r\\n      half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the\\r\\n      weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great\\r\\n      enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\\r\\n      frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine,\\r\\n      was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where\\r\\n      there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but\\r\\n      herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed\\r\\n      away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to\\r\\n      bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a\\r\\n      circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her\\r\\n      arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few\\r\\n      weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom\\r\\n      she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively\\r\\n      new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused\\r\\n      in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s designs on him were, by his\\r\\n      behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by\\r\\n      Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\\r\\n      satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration,\\r\\n      and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been\\r\\n      frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was\\r\\n      walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into\\r\\n      Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and\\r\\n      after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park,\\r\\n      hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following\\r\\n      morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\\r\\n      two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had\\r\\n      brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his\\r\\n      uncle Lord \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\\r\\n      Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte\\r\\n      had seen them from her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, crossing the road, and\\r\\n      immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour\\r\\n      they might expect, adding:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      would never have come so soon to wait upon me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the\\r\\n      compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell,\\r\\n      and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not\\r\\n      handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire\\xe2\\x80\\x94paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to\\r\\n      Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\r\\n      friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth\\r\\n      merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\r\\n      readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very\\r\\n      pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight\\r\\n      observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some\\r\\n      time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his\\r\\n      civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the\\r\\n      health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and\\r\\n      after a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pause, added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you\\r\\n      never happened to see her there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\\r\\n      see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed\\r\\n      between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little\\r\\n      confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to\\r\\n      meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the\\r\\n      gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 31\\r\\n\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manners were very much admired at the\\r\\n      Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably\\r\\n      to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some\\r\\n      days, however, before they received any invitation thither\\xe2\\x80\\x94for\\r\\n      while there were visitors in the house, they could not be\\r\\n      necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after\\r\\n      the gentlemen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arrival, that they were honoured by such an\\r\\n      attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\r\\n      come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very\\r\\n      little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\n      called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy they had seen only at church.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\\r\\n      joined the party in Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drawing-room. Her ladyship\\r\\n      received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by\\r\\n      no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she\\r\\n      was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them,\\r\\n      especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the\\r\\n      room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was\\r\\n      a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty\\r\\n      friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated\\r\\n      himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and\\r\\n      Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books\\r\\n      and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained\\r\\n      in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and\\r\\n      flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well\\r\\n      as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\r\\n      towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,\\r\\n      after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged,\\r\\n      for she did not scruple to call out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are\\r\\n      talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it\\r\\n      is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are speaking of music, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, when no longer able\\r\\n      to avoid a reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my\\r\\n      delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are\\r\\n      speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose,\\r\\n      who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better\\r\\n      natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great\\r\\n      proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to\\r\\n      apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.\\r\\n      How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      proficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady\\r\\n      Catherine; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to\\r\\n      excel if she does not practice a good deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI assure you, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat she does not need such\\r\\n      advice. She practises very constantly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next\\r\\n      write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\\r\\n      account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is\\r\\n      to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet\\r\\n      several times, that she will never play really well unless she\\r\\n      practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is\\r\\n      very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every\\r\\n      day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room. She\\r\\n      would be in nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way, you know, in that part of the house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ill-breeding, and\\r\\n      made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of\\r\\n      having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the\\r\\n      instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to\\r\\n      half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew;\\r\\n      till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual\\r\\n      deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to\\r\\n      command a full view of the fair performer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s countenance.\\r\\n      Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient\\r\\n      pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state\\r\\n      to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play\\r\\n      so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to\\r\\n      be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at\\r\\n      every attempt to intimidate me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall not say you are mistaken,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause you\\r\\n      could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming\\r\\n      you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough\\r\\n      to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing\\r\\n      opinions which in fact are not your own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said\\r\\n      to Colonel Fitzwilliam, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour cousin will give you a very pretty\\r\\n      notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am\\r\\n      particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose\\r\\n      my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to\\r\\n      pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it\\r\\n      is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my\\r\\n      disadvantage in Hertfordshire\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, give me leave to say, very\\r\\n      impolitic too\\xe2\\x80\\x94for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\\r\\n      things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not afraid of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, smilingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should like to know how he behaves among\\r\\n      strangers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou shall hear then\\xe2\\x80\\x94but prepare yourself for something very\\r\\n      dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,\\r\\n      you must know, was at a ball\\xe2\\x80\\x94and at this ball, what do you think\\r\\n      he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;\\r\\n      and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was\\r\\n      sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the\\r\\n      fact.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the\\r\\n      assembly beyond my own party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your\\r\\n      orders.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should have judged better, had I sought\\r\\n      an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to\\r\\n      strangers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth,\\r\\n      still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall we ask him why a man\\r\\n      of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill\\r\\n      qualified to recommend himself to strangers?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can answer your question,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fitzwilliam, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithout applying\\r\\n      to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\r\\n      I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested\\r\\n      in their concerns, as I often see done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy fingers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo not move over this instrument\\r\\n      in the masterly manner which I see so many women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do. They have\\r\\n      not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same\\r\\n      expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own\\r\\n      fault\\xe2\\x80\\x94because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is\\r\\n      not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other\\r\\n      woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of superior execution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy smiled and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are perfectly right. You have\\r\\n      employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege\\r\\n      of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us\\r\\n      perform to strangers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\\r\\n      know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began\\r\\n      playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening\\r\\n      for a few minutes, said to Darcy:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,\\r\\n      and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very\\r\\n      good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to\\r\\n      Anne\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her\\r\\n      health allowed her to learn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\\r\\n      cousin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other\\r\\n      could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his\\r\\n      behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss\\r\\n      Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_,\\r\\n      had she been his relation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance,\\r\\n      mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.\\r\\n      Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility,\\r\\n      and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument\\r\\n      till her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s carriage was ready to take them all home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 32\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\\r\\n      Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the\\r\\n      village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain\\r\\n      signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it\\r\\n      not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension\\r\\n      was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape\\r\\n      all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very\\r\\n      great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for\\r\\n      his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the\\r\\n      ladies were to be within.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were\\r\\n      made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was\\r\\n      absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in\\r\\n      this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on\\r\\n      the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley\\r\\n      to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he\\r\\n      went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope,\\r\\n      when you left London?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerfectly so, I thank you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a\\r\\n      short pause added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\\r\\n      ever returning to Netherfield again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may\\r\\n      spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many\\r\\n      friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements\\r\\n      are continually increasing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better\\r\\n      for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely,\\r\\n      for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But,\\r\\n      perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the\\r\\n      convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must\\r\\n      expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should not be surprised,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif he were to give it\\r\\n      up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\\r\\n      friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to\\r\\n      leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He took the hint, and soon began with, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis seems a very\\r\\n      comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to\\r\\n      it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe she did\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\\r\\n      kindness on a more grateful object.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\\r\\n      wife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\\r\\n      one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him,\\r\\n      or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent\\r\\n      understanding\\xe2\\x80\\x94though I am not certain that I consider her\\r\\n      marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems\\r\\n      perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is\\r\\n      certainly a very good match for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\r\\n      distance of her own family and friends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a\\r\\n      day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should never have considered the distance as one of the\\r\\n      _advantages_ of the match,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should never have\\r\\n      said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything\\r\\n      beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would\\r\\n      appear far.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she\\r\\n      understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\\r\\n      Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\\r\\n      her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on\\r\\n      many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the\\r\\n      expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But\\r\\n      that is not the case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a\\r\\n      comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent\\r\\n      journeys\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself\\r\\n      _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_\\r\\n      cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_\\r\\n      cannot have been always at Longbourn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change\\r\\n      of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the\\r\\n      table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you pleased with Kent?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either\\r\\n      side calm and concise\\xe2\\x80\\x94and soon put an end to by the entrance of\\r\\n      Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The\\r\\n      _t\\xc3\\xaate-\\xc3\\xa0-t\\xc3\\xaate_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which\\r\\n      had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a\\r\\n      few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat can be the meaning of this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Charlotte, as soon as he\\r\\n      was gone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he\\r\\n      would never have called on us in this familiar way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very\\r\\n      likely, even to Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wishes, to be the case; and after\\r\\n      various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to\\r\\n      proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was\\r\\n      the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were\\r\\n      over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a\\r\\n      billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and\\r\\n      in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk\\r\\n      to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\\r\\n      temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\r\\n      They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\r\\n      separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by\\r\\n      their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\n      came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which\\r\\n      of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded\\r\\n      by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his\\r\\n      evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George\\r\\n      Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less\\r\\n      captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manners, she\\r\\n      believed he might have the best informed mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\\r\\n      difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he\\r\\n      frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his\\r\\n      lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity\\r\\n      rather than of choice\\xe2\\x80\\x94a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to\\r\\n      himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew\\r\\n      not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s occasionally\\r\\n      laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally\\r\\n      different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\\r\\n      her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the\\r\\n      effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she\\r\\n      set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him\\r\\n      whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford;\\r\\n      but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a\\r\\n      great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It\\r\\n      was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether\\r\\n      there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing\\r\\n      but absence of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of\\r\\n      his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the\\r\\n      idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the\\r\\n      subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only\\r\\n      end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a\\r\\n      doubt, that all her friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dislike would vanish, if she could\\r\\n      suppose him to be in her power.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her\\r\\n      marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most\\r\\n      pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life\\r\\n      was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin\\r\\n      could have none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 33\\r\\n\\r\\n      More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\r\\n      unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\\r\\n      mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought,\\r\\n      and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him\\r\\n      at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could\\r\\n      occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and\\r\\n      even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary\\r\\n      penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal\\r\\n      enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually\\r\\n      thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never\\r\\n      said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of\\r\\n      talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of\\r\\n      their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected\\r\\n      questions\\xe2\\x80\\x94about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of\\r\\n      solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly\\r\\n      understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she\\r\\n      came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words\\r\\n      seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his\\r\\n      thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an\\r\\n      allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a\\r\\n      little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\\r\\n      pales opposite the Parsonage.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last\\r\\n      letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had\\r\\n      not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was\\r\\n      meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a\\r\\n      smile, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not know before that you ever walked this way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been making the tour of the park,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas I\\r\\n      generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at\\r\\n      the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I should have turned in a moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\\r\\n      Parsonage together.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x94if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his\\r\\n      disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\\r\\n      least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know\\r\\n      anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes\\r\\n      than Mr. Darcy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe likes to have his own way very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut so we all do. It is only that he has better\\r\\n      means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many\\r\\n      others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must\\r\\n      be inured to self-denial and dependence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little\\r\\n      of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial\\r\\n      and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money\\r\\n      from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a\\r\\n      fancy for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are home questions\\xe2\\x80\\x94and perhaps I cannot say that I have\\r\\n      experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of\\r\\n      greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons\\r\\n      cannot marry where they like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very\\r\\n      often do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not\\r\\n      many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some\\r\\n      attention to money.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmeant for me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she coloured at\\r\\n      the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd\\r\\n      pray, what is the usual price of an earl\\xe2\\x80\\x99s younger son? Unless\\r\\n      the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask\\r\\n      above fifty thousand pounds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To\\r\\n      interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with\\r\\n      what had passed, she soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the\\r\\n      sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not\\r\\n      marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But,\\r\\n      perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is\\r\\n      under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is an advantage which he\\r\\n      must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of\\r\\n      Miss Darcy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make?\\r\\n      Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age\\r\\n      are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the\\r\\n      true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\\r\\n      manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss\\r\\n      Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she\\r\\n      had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly\\r\\n      replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I\\r\\n      dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\r\\n      She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my\\r\\n      acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard\\r\\n      you say that you know them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\\r\\n      man\\xe2\\x80\\x94he is a great friend of Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth drily; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCare of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him\\r\\n      in those points where he most wants care. From something that he\\r\\n      told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley\\r\\n      very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I\\r\\n      have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It\\r\\n      was all conjecture.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\\r\\n      known, because if it were to get round to the lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family, it\\r\\n      would be an unpleasant thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\\r\\n      Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated\\r\\n      himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences\\r\\n      of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any\\r\\n      other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from\\r\\n      believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that\\r\\n      sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of\\r\\n      last summer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI understood that there were some very strong objections against\\r\\n      the lady.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what arts did he use to separate them?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe did not talk to me of his own arts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fitzwilliam,\\r\\n      smiling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe only told me what I have now told you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\\r\\n      indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her\\r\\n      why she was so thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am thinking of what you have been telling me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour\\r\\n      cousin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\\r\\n      judge?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety\\r\\n      of his friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement\\r\\n      alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend\\r\\n      was to be happy. But,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued, recollecting herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas\\r\\n      we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.\\r\\n      It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the\\r\\n      case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is not an unnatural surmise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fitzwilliam, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it is\\r\\n      a lessening of the honour of my cousin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s triumph very sadly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a\\r\\n      picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an\\r\\n      answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked\\r\\n      on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There,\\r\\n      shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she\\r\\n      could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It\\r\\n      was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than\\r\\n      those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the\\r\\n      world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless\\r\\n      influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to\\r\\n      separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\\r\\n      always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\\r\\n      arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead\\r\\n      him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of\\r\\n      all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had\\r\\n      ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most\\r\\n      affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say\\r\\n      how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were some very strong objections against the lady,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words; and those strong objections probably\\r\\n      were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and\\r\\n      another who was in business in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo Jane herself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere could be no possibility\\r\\n      of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!\\xe2\\x80\\x94her\\r\\n      understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners\\r\\n      captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father,\\r\\n      who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will\\r\\n      probably never reach.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When she thought of her mother, her\\r\\n      confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any\\r\\n      objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\r\\n      pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the\\r\\n      want of importance in his friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connections, than from their\\r\\n      want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had\\r\\n      been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by\\r\\n      the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on\\r\\n      a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that,\\r\\n      added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her\\r\\n      not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to\\r\\n      drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did\\r\\n      not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband\\r\\n      from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his\\r\\n      apprehension of Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being rather displeased by her\\r\\n      staying at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 34\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate\\r\\n      herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her\\r\\n      employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had\\r\\n      written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual\\r\\n      complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any\\r\\n      communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost\\r\\n      every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which\\r\\n      had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding\\r\\n      from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\r\\n      disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\r\\n      Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of\\r\\n      uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the\\r\\n      first perusal. Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shameful boast of what misery he had\\r\\n      been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to\\r\\n      Rosings was to end on the day after the next\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, a still\\r\\n      greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with\\r\\n      Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\r\\n      spirits, by all that affection could do.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She could not think of Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaving Kent without remembering\\r\\n      that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\n      made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as\\r\\n      he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound\\r\\n      of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the\\r\\n      idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once\\r\\n      before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire\\r\\n      particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her\\r\\n      spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter\\r\\n      amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried\\r\\n      manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing\\r\\n      his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered\\r\\n      him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then\\r\\n      getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\\r\\n      said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came\\r\\n      towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not\\r\\n      be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire\\r\\n      and love you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared,\\r\\n      coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient\\r\\n      encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long\\r\\n      felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were\\r\\n      feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was\\r\\n      not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His\\r\\n      sense of her inferiority\\xe2\\x80\\x94of its being a degradation\\xe2\\x80\\x94of the family\\r\\n      obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on\\r\\n      with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was\\r\\n      wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be\\r\\n      insensible to the compliment of such a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affection, and\\r\\n      though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at\\r\\n      first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to\\r\\n      resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in\\r\\n      anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with\\r\\n      patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\\r\\n      representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in\\r\\n      spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer;\\r\\n      and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her\\r\\n      acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see\\r\\n      that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of\\r\\n      apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\\r\\n      security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and,\\r\\n      when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\r\\n      express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\\r\\n      unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation\\r\\n      should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now\\r\\n      thank you. But I cannot\\xe2\\x80\\x94I have never desired your good opinion,\\r\\n      and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry\\r\\n      to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously\\r\\n      done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings\\r\\n      which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of\\r\\n      your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after\\r\\n      this explanation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes\\r\\n      fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less\\r\\n      resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger,\\r\\n      and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He\\r\\n      was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not\\r\\n      open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The\\r\\n      pause was to Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings dreadful. At length, with a\\r\\n      voice of forced calmness, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of\\r\\n      expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\\r\\n      little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of\\r\\n      small importance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI might as well enquire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy with so evident a\\r\\n      desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that\\r\\n      you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even\\r\\n      against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility,\\r\\n      if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I\\r\\n      have. Had not my feelings decided against you\\xe2\\x80\\x94had they been\\r\\n      indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\\r\\n      any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been\\r\\n      the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\\r\\n      beloved sister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the\\r\\n      emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to\\r\\n      interrupt her while she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive\\r\\n      can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You\\r\\n      dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if\\r\\n      not the only means of dividing them from each other\\xe2\\x80\\x94of exposing\\r\\n      one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and\\r\\n      the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving\\r\\n      them both in misery of the acutest kind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\\r\\n      listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any\\r\\n      feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of\\r\\n      affected incredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you deny that you have done it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With assumed tranquillity he then replied: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no wish of\\r\\n      denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend\\r\\n      from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_\\r\\n      I have been kinder than towards myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil\\r\\n      reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\\r\\n      conciliate her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it is not merely this affair,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9con which my\\r\\n      dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of\\r\\n      you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which\\r\\n      I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject,\\r\\n      what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can\\r\\n      you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you\\r\\n      here impose upon others?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou take an eager interest in that gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerns,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling\\r\\n      an interest in him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis misfortunes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Darcy contemptuously; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes, his\\r\\n      misfortunes have been great indeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd of your infliction,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth with energy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have\\r\\n      reduced him to his present state of poverty\\xe2\\x80\\x94comparative poverty.\\r\\n      You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been\\r\\n      designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of\\r\\n      that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You\\r\\n      have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his\\r\\n      misfortune with contempt and ridicule.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the\\r\\n      room, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you\\r\\n      hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,\\r\\n      according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthese\\r\\n      offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt\\r\\n      by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented\\r\\n      my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might\\r\\n      have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my\\r\\n      struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled\\r\\n      by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection,\\r\\n      by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor\\r\\n      am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\\r\\n      just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\\r\\n      connections?\\xe2\\x80\\x94to congratulate myself on the hope of relations,\\r\\n      whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\\r\\n      tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of\\r\\n      your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared\\r\\n      me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you\\r\\n      behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she\\r\\n      continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\\r\\n      way that would have tempted me to accept it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\\r\\n      expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom the very beginning\\xe2\\x80\\x94from the first moment, I may almost\\r\\n      say\\xe2\\x80\\x94of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with\\r\\n      the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your\\r\\n      selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form\\r\\n      the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have\\r\\n      built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month\\r\\n      before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I\\r\\n      could ever be prevailed on to marry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\\r\\n      feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have\\r\\n      been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and\\r\\n      accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth\\r\\n      heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\\r\\n      to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried\\r\\n      for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had\\r\\n      passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should\\r\\n      receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have\\r\\n      been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to\\r\\n      wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made\\r\\n      him prevent his friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marrying her sister, and which must\\r\\n      appear at least with equal force in his own case\\xe2\\x80\\x94was almost\\r\\n      incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so\\r\\n      strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride\\xe2\\x80\\x94his\\r\\n      shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x94his\\r\\n      unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not\\r\\n      justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to\\r\\n      deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\\r\\n      attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very\\r\\n      agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s carriage\\r\\n      made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 35\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and\\r\\n      meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not\\r\\n      yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was\\r\\n      impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for\\r\\n      employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge\\r\\n      herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her\\r\\n      favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sometimes\\r\\n      coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she\\r\\n      turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\\r\\n      park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\\r\\n      passed one of the gates into the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she\\r\\n      was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the\\r\\n      gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now\\r\\n      passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and\\r\\n      every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was\\r\\n      on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of\\r\\n      a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was\\r\\n      moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was\\r\\n      directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near\\r\\n      enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\r\\n      pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself\\r\\n      called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she\\r\\n      moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it\\r\\n      also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took,\\r\\n      said, with a look of haughty composure, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been walking in\\r\\n      the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me\\r\\n      the honour of reading that letter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And then, with a slight bow,\\r\\n      turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest\\r\\n      curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still\\r\\n      increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of\\r\\n      letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The\\r\\n      envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the\\r\\n      lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight\\r\\n      o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, and was as follows:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\\r\\n      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments\\r\\n      or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to\\r\\n      you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\\r\\n      myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,\\r\\n      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation\\r\\n      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\\r\\n      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.\\r\\n      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your\\r\\n      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but\\r\\n      I demand it of your justice.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of\\r\\n      equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first\\r\\n      mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I\\r\\n      had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I\\r\\n      had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\\r\\n      humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\\r\\n      prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown\\r\\n      off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my\\r\\n      father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on\\r\\n      our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its\\r\\n      exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two\\r\\n      young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few\\r\\n      weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that\\r\\n      blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each\\r\\n      circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the\\r\\n      following account of my actions and their motives has been read.\\r\\n      If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am\\r\\n      under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive\\r\\n      to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be\\r\\n      obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\\r\\n      with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any\\r\\n      other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening\\r\\n      of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his\\r\\n      feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love\\r\\n      before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you,\\r\\n      I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accidental\\r\\n      information, that Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attentions to your sister had given\\r\\n      rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it\\r\\n      as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\r\\n      From that moment I observed my friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behaviour attentively;\\r\\n      and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\\r\\n      beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\\r\\n      watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging\\r\\n      as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I\\r\\n      remained convinced from the evening\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scrutiny, that though she\\r\\n      received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by\\r\\n      any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\\r\\n      here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of\\r\\n      your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have\\r\\n      been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment\\r\\n      has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,\\r\\n      that the serenity of your sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s countenance and air was such\\r\\n      as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,\\r\\n      however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily\\r\\n      touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\\r\\n      certain\\xe2\\x80\\x94but I will venture to say that my investigation and\\r\\n      decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did\\r\\n      not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed\\r\\n      it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My\\r\\n      objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\\r\\n      night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion\\r\\n      to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be\\r\\n      so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other\\r\\n      causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and\\r\\n      existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself\\r\\n      endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\\r\\n      me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of\\r\\n      your mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\r\\n      comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so\\r\\n      almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger\\r\\n      sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It\\r\\n      pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects\\r\\n      of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\r\\n      representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider\\r\\n      that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\\r\\n      the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and\\r\\n      your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and\\r\\n      disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what\\r\\n      passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and\\r\\n      every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to\\r\\n      preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\r\\n      connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,\\r\\n      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\\r\\n      returning.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n      uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence\\r\\n      of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time\\r\\n      was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on\\r\\n      joining him directly in London. We accordingly went\\xe2\\x80\\x94and there I\\r\\n      readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the\\r\\n      certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them\\r\\n      earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or\\r\\n      delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would\\r\\n      ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded\\r\\n      by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection\\r\\n      with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\\r\\n      natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than\\r\\n      on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived\\r\\n      himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against\\r\\n      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\\r\\n      given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself\\r\\n      for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in\\r\\n      the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it\\r\\n      is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to\\r\\n      conceal from him your sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being in town. I knew it myself,\\r\\n      as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet\\r\\n      ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence\\r\\n      is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough\\r\\n      extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\\r\\n      concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,\\r\\n      and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more\\r\\n      to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\\r\\n      sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives\\r\\n      which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient,\\r\\n      I have not yet learnt to condemn them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having\\r\\n      injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you\\r\\n      the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has\\r\\n      _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what\\r\\n      I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted\\r\\n      veracity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\\r\\n      many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose\\r\\n      good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my\\r\\n      father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was\\r\\n      his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My\\r\\n      father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge\\xe2\\x80\\x94most\\r\\n      important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the\\r\\n      extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a\\r\\n      gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s education. My father was not only fond of this young\\r\\n      man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also\\r\\n      the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his\\r\\n      profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it\\r\\n      is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very\\r\\n      different manner. The vicious propensities\\xe2\\x80\\x94the want of principle,\\r\\n      which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best\\r\\n      friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly\\r\\n      the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing\\r\\n      him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here\\r\\n      again I shall give you pain\\xe2\\x80\\x94to what degree you only can tell. But\\r\\n      whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\\r\\n      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\\r\\n      real character\\xe2\\x80\\x94it adds even another motive.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy excellent father died about five years ago; and his\\r\\n      attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his\\r\\n      will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\\r\\n      advancement in the best manner that his profession might\\r\\n      allow\\xe2\\x80\\x94and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family\\r\\n      living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a\\r\\n      legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\\r\\n      survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against\\r\\n      taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for\\r\\n      him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of\\r\\n      the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some\\r\\n      intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that\\r\\n      the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient\\r\\n      support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be\\r\\n      sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\\r\\n      proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;\\r\\n      the business was therefore soon settled\\xe2\\x80\\x94he resigned all claim to\\r\\n      assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be\\r\\n      in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three\\r\\n      thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved.\\r\\n      I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his\\r\\n      society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his\\r\\n      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all\\r\\n      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For\\r\\n      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of\\r\\n      the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he\\r\\n      applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\\r\\n      circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in\\r\\n      believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most\\r\\n      unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being\\r\\n      ordained, if I would present him to the living in question\\xe2\\x80\\x94of\\r\\n      which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well\\r\\n      assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could\\r\\n      not have forgotten my revered father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intentions. You will\\r\\n      hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\\r\\n      resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in\\r\\n      proportion to the distress of his circumstances\\xe2\\x80\\x94and he was\\r\\n      doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\\r\\n      reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of\\r\\n      acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last\\r\\n      summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\\r\\n      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should\\r\\n      induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I\\r\\n      feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten\\r\\n      years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she\\r\\n      was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in\\r\\n      London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over\\r\\n      it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly\\r\\n      by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance\\r\\n      between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most\\r\\n      unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far\\r\\n      recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart\\r\\n      retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child,\\r\\n      that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent\\r\\n      to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\\r\\n      excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that\\r\\n      I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly\\r\\n      a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana,\\r\\n      unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother\\r\\n      whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole\\r\\n      to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my\\r\\n      sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I\\r\\n      wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.\\r\\n      Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief\\r\\n      object was unquestionably my sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fortune, which is thirty\\r\\n      thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of\\r\\n      revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge\\r\\n      would have been complete indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\\r\\n      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject\\r\\n      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\\r\\n      towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form\\r\\n      of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not\\r\\n      perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of\\r\\n      everything concerning either, detection could not be in your\\r\\n      power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last\\r\\n      night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what\\r\\n      could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\\r\\n      related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant\\r\\n      intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of\\r\\n      these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_\\r\\n      assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause\\r\\n      from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the\\r\\n      possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some\\r\\n      opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of\\r\\n      the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFITZWILLIAM DARCY\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 36\\r\\n\\r\\n      If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect\\r\\n      it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no\\r\\n      expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may\\r\\n      well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a\\r\\n      contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read\\r\\n      were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first\\r\\n      understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\\r\\n      steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\r\\n      to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a\\r\\n      strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his\\r\\n      account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an\\r\\n      eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from\\r\\n      impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was\\r\\n      incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.\\r\\n      His belief of her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insensibility she instantly resolved\\r\\n      to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to\\r\\n      the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him\\r\\n      justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which\\r\\n      satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was\\r\\n      all pride and insolence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x94when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation\\r\\n      of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion\\r\\n      of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own\\r\\n      history of himself\\xe2\\x80\\x94her feelings were yet more acutely painful and\\r\\n      more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and\\r\\n      even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely,\\r\\n      repeatedly exclaiming, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis must be false! This cannot be! This\\r\\n      must be the grossest falsehood!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94and when she had gone through\\r\\n      the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last\\r\\n      page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\\r\\n      regard it, that she would never look in it again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\r\\n      nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the\\r\\n      letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she\\r\\n      could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related\\r\\n      to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the\\r\\n      meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the\\r\\n      Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the\\r\\n      kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known\\r\\n      its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each\\r\\n      recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the\\r\\n      difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was\\r\\n      fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\\r\\n      impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side\\r\\n      or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that\\r\\n      her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the\\r\\n      closest attention, the particulars immediately following of\\r\\n      Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his\\r\\n      receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds,\\r\\n      again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter,\\r\\n      weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\\r\\n      impartiality\\xe2\\x80\\x94deliberated on the probability of each statement\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\r\\n      with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again\\r\\n      she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,\\r\\n      which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could\\r\\n      so represent as to render Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conduct in it less than\\r\\n      infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely\\r\\n      blameless throughout the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to\\r\\n      lay at Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more\\r\\n      so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never\\r\\n      heard of him before his entrance into the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire Militia, in\\r\\n      which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on\\r\\n      meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight\\r\\n      acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character,\\r\\n      had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of\\r\\n      enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him\\r\\n      at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect\\r\\n      some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity\\r\\n      or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for\\r\\n      those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n      continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could\\r\\n      see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address;\\r\\n      but she could remember no more substantial good than the general\\r\\n      approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social\\r\\n      powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a\\r\\n      considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas!\\r\\n      the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received\\r\\n      some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she\\r\\n      was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam himself\\xe2\\x80\\x94from whom she had previously received the\\r\\n      information of his near concern in all his cousin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affairs, and\\r\\n      whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she\\r\\n      had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked\\r\\n      by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly\\r\\n      banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have\\r\\n      hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\\r\\n      cousin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s corroboration.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\\r\\n      conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening\\r\\n      at Mr. Phillips\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in\\r\\n      her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such\\r\\n      communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her\\r\\n      before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he\\r\\n      had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his\\r\\n      conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of\\r\\n      seeing Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x94that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\\r\\n      _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield\\r\\n      ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the\\r\\n      Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story\\r\\n      to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been\\r\\n      everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples\\r\\n      in sinking Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character, though he had assured her that\\r\\n      respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.\\r\\n\\r\\n      How differently did everything now appear in which he was\\r\\n      concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence\\r\\n      of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of\\r\\n      her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but\\r\\n      his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself\\r\\n      could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been\\r\\n      deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his\\r\\n      vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had\\r\\n      most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour\\r\\n      grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned\\r\\n      by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;\\r\\n      that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in\\r\\n      the whole course of their acquaintance\\xe2\\x80\\x94an acquaintance which had\\r\\n      latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of\\r\\n      intimacy with his ways\\xe2\\x80\\x94seen anything that betrayed him to be\\r\\n      unprincipled or unjust\\xe2\\x80\\x94anything that spoke him of irreligious or\\r\\n      immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed\\r\\n      and valued\\xe2\\x80\\x94that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother,\\r\\n      and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\\r\\n      sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had\\r\\n      his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a\\r\\n      violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed\\r\\n      from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of\\r\\n      it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor\\r\\n      Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,\\r\\n      partial, prejudiced, absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow despicably I have acted!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI, who have prided\\r\\n      myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my\\r\\n      abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my\\r\\n      sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\r\\n      How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation!\\r\\n      Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\r\\n      But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the\\r\\n      preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on\\r\\n      the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\r\\n      prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either\\r\\n      were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      From herself to Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x94from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a\\r\\n      line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read\\r\\n      it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\r\\n      How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,\\r\\n      which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared\\r\\n      himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attachment;\\r\\n      and she could not help remembering what Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion had\\r\\n      always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his\\r\\n      description of Jane. She felt that Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings, though\\r\\n      fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\\r\\n      complacency in her air and manner not often united with great\\r\\n      sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\r\\n      mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her\\r\\n      sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her\\r\\n      too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he\\r\\n      particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball,\\r\\n      and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have\\r\\n      made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It\\r\\n      soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had\\r\\n      thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she\\r\\n      considered that Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disappointment had in fact been the work\\r\\n      of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit\\r\\n      of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt\\r\\n      depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\\r\\n      variety of thought\\xe2\\x80\\x94re-considering events, determining\\r\\n      probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to\\r\\n      a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection\\r\\n      of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she\\r\\n      entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,\\r\\n      and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make\\r\\n      her unfit for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had\\r\\n      each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few\\r\\n      minutes, to take leave\\xe2\\x80\\x94but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been\\r\\n      sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and\\r\\n      almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\r\\n      Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she\\r\\n      really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an\\r\\n      object; she could think only of her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 37\\r\\n\\r\\n      The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins\\r\\n      having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting\\r\\n      obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of\\r\\n      their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits\\r\\n      as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone\\r\\n      through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady\\r\\n      Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with\\r\\n      great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that\\r\\n      she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having\\r\\n      them all to dine with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\\r\\n      had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to\\r\\n      her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of\\r\\n      what her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s indignation would have been. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat would she\\r\\n      have said? how would she have behaved?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were questions with which\\r\\n      she amused herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\n      assure you, I feel it exceedingly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Catherine; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\n      believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I\\r\\n      am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be\\r\\n      so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so\\r\\n      they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably\\r\\n      till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,\\r\\n      more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings\\r\\n      certainly increases.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\\r\\n      which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\\r\\n      out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by\\r\\n      supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she\\r\\n      added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg\\r\\n      that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad\\r\\n      of your company, I am sure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      replied Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it is not in my power to accept it. I\\r\\n      must be in town next Saturday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I\\r\\n      expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before\\r\\n      you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\r\\n      Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if\\r\\n      you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to\\r\\n      take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in\\r\\n      June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the\\r\\n      barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\n      indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not\\r\\n      object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\\r\\n      original plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine seemed resigned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Collins, you must send a\\r\\n      servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot\\r\\n      bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.\\r\\n      It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have\\r\\n      the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young\\r\\n      women should always be properly guarded and attended, according\\r\\n      to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to\\r\\n      Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two\\r\\n      men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy,\\r\\n      of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\\r\\n      propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to\\r\\n      all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.\\r\\n      Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would\\r\\n      really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy uncle is to send a servant for us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad\\r\\n      you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you\\r\\n      change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at\\r\\n      the Bell, you will be attended to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\\r\\n      journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention\\r\\n      was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or,\\r\\n      with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\r\\n      Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was\\r\\n      alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day\\r\\n      went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in\\r\\n      all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by\\r\\n      heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its\\r\\n      writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the\\r\\n      style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when\\r\\n      she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,\\r\\n      her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed\\r\\n      feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited\\r\\n      gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not\\r\\n      approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\\r\\n      feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own\\r\\n      past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and\\r\\n      regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of\\r\\n      yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father,\\r\\n      contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to\\r\\n      restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her\\r\\n      mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely\\r\\n      insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane\\r\\n      in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;\\r\\n      but while they were supported by their mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s indulgence, what\\r\\n      chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\\r\\n      irritable, and completely under Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guidance, had been always\\r\\n      affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,\\r\\n      would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and\\r\\n      vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt\\r\\n      with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they\\r\\n      would be going there forever.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Anxiety on Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good\\r\\n      opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His\\r\\n      affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct\\r\\n      cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness\\r\\n      of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the\\r\\n      thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so\\r\\n      replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been\\r\\n      deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\r\\n\\r\\n      When to these recollections was added the development of\\r\\n      Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character, it may be easily believed that the happy\\r\\n      spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much\\r\\n      affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear\\r\\n      tolerably cheerful.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\\r\\n      week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening\\r\\n      was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into\\r\\n      the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the\\r\\n      best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of\\r\\n      placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself\\r\\n      obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and\\r\\n      pack her trunk afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\\r\\n      wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford\\r\\n      again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to\\r\\n      curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 38\\r\\n\\r\\n      On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a\\r\\n      few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the\\r\\n      opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed\\r\\n      indispensably necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know not, Miss Elizabeth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether Mrs. Collins has\\r\\n      yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I\\r\\n      am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving\\r\\n      her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt,\\r\\n      I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our\\r\\n      humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few\\r\\n      domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford\\r\\n      extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will\\r\\n      believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done\\r\\n      everything in our power to prevent your spending your time\\r\\n      unpleasantly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.\\r\\n      She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of\\r\\n      being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received,\\r\\n      must make _her_ feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and\\r\\n      with a more smiling solemnity replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\r\\n      time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most\\r\\n      fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very\\r\\n      superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the\\r\\n      frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may\\r\\n      flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been\\r\\n      entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing\\r\\n      which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see\\r\\n      how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge\\r\\n      that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I\\r\\n      should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion,\\r\\n      while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he\\r\\n      was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to\\r\\n      unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\r\\n      Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you\\r\\n      will be able to do so. Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great attentions to Mrs.\\r\\n      Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust\\r\\n      it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\r\\n      on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure\\r\\n      you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most\\r\\n      cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte\\r\\n      and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in\\r\\n      everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas\\r\\n      between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where\\r\\n      that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she\\r\\n      firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was\\r\\n      not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by\\r\\n      the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy\\r\\n      to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes\\r\\n      open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to\\r\\n      go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her\\r\\n      housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent\\r\\n      concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\\r\\n      parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After\\r\\n      an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was\\r\\n      attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down\\r\\n      the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all\\r\\n      her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had\\r\\n      received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr.\\r\\n      and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria\\r\\n      followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he\\r\\n      suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\\r\\n      hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at\\r\\n      Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou will of course wish to have your humble\\r\\n      respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their\\r\\n      kindness to you while you have been here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be\\r\\n      shut, and the carriage drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood gracious!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Maria, after a few minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 silence, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\r\\n      seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many\\r\\n      things have happened!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA great many indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her companion with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\\r\\n      twice! How much I shall have to tell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth added privately, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd how much I shall have to\\r\\n      conceal!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any\\r\\n      alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they\\r\\n      reached Mr. Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house, where they were to remain a few\\r\\n      days.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of\\r\\n      studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the\\r\\n      kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go\\r\\n      home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for\\r\\n      observation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even\\r\\n      for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would\\r\\n      so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so\\r\\n      highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been\\r\\n      able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing\\r\\n      could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she\\r\\n      remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her\\r\\n      fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\\r\\n      repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister\\r\\n      further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 39\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies\\r\\n      set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94, in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.\\r\\n      Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in\\r\\n      token of the coachman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking\\r\\n      out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an\\r\\n      hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite\\r\\n      milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad\\r\\n      and cucumber.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a\\r\\n      table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually\\r\\n      affords, exclaiming, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs not this nice? Is not this an agreeable\\r\\n      surprise?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd we mean to treat you all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Lydia, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you must lend\\r\\n      us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      Then, showing her purchases\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook here, I have bought this\\r\\n      bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might\\r\\n      as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get\\r\\n      home, and see if I can make it up any better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\r\\n      unconcern, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! but there were two or three much uglier in the\\r\\n      shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim\\r\\n      it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it\\r\\n      will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre they indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, with the greatest\\r\\n      satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want\\r\\n      papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a\\r\\n      delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at\\r\\n      all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a\\r\\n      miserable summer else we shall have!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_that_ would be a delightful scheme\\r\\n      indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton,\\r\\n      and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset\\r\\n      already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of\\r\\n      Meryton!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I have got some news for you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lydia, as they sat down\\r\\n      at table. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think? It is excellent news\\xe2\\x80\\x94capital\\r\\n      news\\xe2\\x80\\x94and about a certain person we all like!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told\\r\\n      he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You\\r\\n      thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he\\r\\n      often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is\\r\\n      an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long\\r\\n      chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear\\r\\n      Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger\\r\\n      of Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marrying Mary King. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for you! She is gone\\r\\n      down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd Mary King is safe!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9csafe from a connection\\r\\n      imprudent as to fortune.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never\\r\\n      cared three straws about her\\xe2\\x80\\x94who _could_ about such a nasty\\r\\n      little freckled thing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\r\\n      coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the\\r\\n      _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had harboured\\r\\n      and fancied liberal!\\r\\n\\r\\n      As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\r\\n      ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all\\r\\n      their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition\\r\\n      of Kitty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purchases, were seated in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow nicely we are all crammed in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Lydia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad I\\r\\n      bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another\\r\\n      bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk\\r\\n      and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear\\r\\n      what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen\\r\\n      any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes\\r\\n      that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.\\r\\n      Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost\\r\\n      three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being\\r\\n      married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to\\r\\n      get husbands, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think. She says Lizzy had better have\\r\\n      taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any\\r\\n      fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of\\r\\n      you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear\\r\\n      me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel\\r\\n      Forster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.\\r\\n      Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the\\r\\n      bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked\\r\\n      the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was\\r\\n      forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\\r\\n      dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clothes on purpose to pass for\\r\\n      a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel\\r\\n      and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were\\r\\n      forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how\\r\\n      well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or\\r\\n      three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the\\r\\n      least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I\\r\\n      should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and\\r\\n      then they soon found out what was the matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\r\\n      Lydia, assisted by Kitty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hints and additions, endeavour to\\r\\n      amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened\\r\\n      as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent\\r\\n      mention of Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to\\r\\n      see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner\\r\\n      did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\\r\\n      Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were\\r\\n      the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was enquiring of\\r\\n      Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of\\r\\n      the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and,\\r\\n      on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and\\r\\n      Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, was\\r\\n      enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who\\r\\n      would hear her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Mary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish you had gone with us, for we had\\r\\n      such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and\\r\\n      pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone\\r\\n      so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to\\r\\n      the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated\\r\\n      the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and\\r\\n      if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then\\r\\n      when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have\\r\\n      got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we\\r\\n      were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,\\r\\n      that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      To this Mary very gravely replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFar be it from me, my dear\\r\\n      sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be\\r\\n      congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they\\r\\n      would have no charms for _me_\\xe2\\x80\\x94I should infinitely prefer a book.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\\r\\n      anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary\\r\\n      at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to\\r\\n      walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth\\r\\n      steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss\\r\\n      Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in\\r\\n      pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her\\r\\n      opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was\\r\\n      resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_ of\\r\\n      the regiment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.\\r\\n      In a fortnight they were to go\\xe2\\x80\\x94and once gone, she hoped there\\r\\n      could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had not been many hours at home before she found that the\\r\\n      Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn,\\r\\n      was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw\\r\\n      directly that her father had not the smallest intention of\\r\\n      yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and\\r\\n      equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never\\r\\n      yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 40\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\\r\\n      could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress\\r\\n      every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing\\r\\n      her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the\\r\\n      chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong\\r\\n      sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear\\r\\n      perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other\\r\\n      feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his\\r\\n      sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but\\r\\n      still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      refusal must have given him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand\\r\\n      certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it\\r\\n      must increase his disappointment!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am heartily sorry for him; but he\\r\\n      has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his\\r\\n      regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlame you! Oh, no.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo\\xe2\\x80\\x94I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very\\r\\n      next day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents\\r\\n      as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this\\r\\n      for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world\\r\\n      without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole\\r\\n      race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was\\r\\n      Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of\\r\\n      consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour\\r\\n      to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one\\r\\n      without involving the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis will not do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou never will be able to\\r\\n      make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you\\r\\n      must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of\\r\\n      merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and\\r\\n      of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am\\r\\n      inclined to believe it all Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s; but you shall do as you\\r\\n      choose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from\\r\\n      Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know when I have been more shocked,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWickham\\r\\n      so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear\\r\\n      Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a\\r\\n      disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!\\r\\n      and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too\\r\\n      distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you\\r\\n      so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that\\r\\n      I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your\\r\\n      profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much\\r\\n      longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\r\\n      countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of\\r\\n      those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other\\r\\n      all the appearance of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it\\r\\n      as you used to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a\\r\\n      dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\r\\n      One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but\\r\\n      one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then\\r\\n      stumbling on something witty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not\\r\\n      treat the matter as you do now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say\\r\\n      unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane\\r\\n      to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain\\r\\n      and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow unfortunate that you should have used such very strong\\r\\n      expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they\\r\\n      _do_ appear wholly undeserved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a\\r\\n      most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\\r\\n      encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I\\r\\n      want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our\\r\\n      acquaintances in general understand Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSurely there can\\r\\n      be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your\\r\\n      opinion?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised\\r\\n      me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every\\r\\n      particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as\\r\\n      possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to\\r\\n      the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general\\r\\n      prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the\\r\\n      death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him\\r\\n      in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be\\r\\n      gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he\\r\\n      really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we\\r\\n      may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present\\r\\n      I will say nothing about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin\\r\\n      him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and\\r\\n      anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him\\r\\n      desperate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The tumult of Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\r\\n      She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her\\r\\n      for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,\\r\\n      whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was\\r\\n      still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the\\r\\n      disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been\\r\\n      valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could\\r\\n      partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\\r\\n      understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing\\r\\n      off this last encumbrance of mystery. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif\\r\\n      that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely\\r\\n      be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable\\r\\n      manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till\\r\\n      it has lost all its value!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\\r\\n      real state of her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still\\r\\n      cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even\\r\\n      fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of\\r\\n      first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater\\r\\n      steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so\\r\\n      fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every\\r\\n      other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\r\\n      feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence\\r\\n      of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health\\r\\n      and their tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Lizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet one day, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat is your opinion\\r\\n      _now_ of this sad business of Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s? For my part, I am\\r\\n      determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my\\r\\n      sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane\\r\\n      saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving\\r\\n      young man\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I do not suppose there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the least chance in the\\r\\n      world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming\\r\\n      to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of\\r\\n      everybody, too, who is likely to know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come.\\r\\n      Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and\\r\\n      if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort\\r\\n      is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will\\r\\n      be sorry for what he has done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\\r\\n      expectation, she made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Lizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued her mother, soon afterwards, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand so the\\r\\n      Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope\\r\\n      it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is\\r\\n      an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her\\r\\n      mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in\\r\\n      _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, nothing at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes.\\r\\n      _They_ will take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will\\r\\n      never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!\\r\\n      And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your\\r\\n      father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say,\\r\\n      whenever that happens.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a subject which they could not mention before me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt\\r\\n      they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be\\r\\n      easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the\\r\\n      better. _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only\\r\\n      entailed on me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 41\\r\\n\\r\\n      The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.\\r\\n      It was the last of the regiment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stay in Meryton, and all the\\r\\n      young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The\\r\\n      dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were\\r\\n      still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course\\r\\n      of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for\\r\\n      this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was\\r\\n      extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in\\r\\n      any of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would\\r\\n      they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can you be\\r\\n      smiling so, Lizzy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\\r\\n      what she had herself endured on a similar occasion,\\r\\n      five-and-twenty years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cried for two days together when\\r\\n      Colonel Miller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regiment went away. I thought I should have\\r\\n      broken my heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure I shall break _mine_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf one could but go to Brighton!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x94if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\\r\\n      disagreeable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of\\r\\n      good,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\\r\\n      Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all\\r\\n      sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objections; and never had she been so much disposed\\r\\n      to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But the gloom of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\\r\\n      she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the\\r\\n      colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This\\r\\n      invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately\\r\\n      married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had\\r\\n      recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_\\r\\n      months\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\r\\n      Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of\\r\\n      Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her\\r\\n      sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless\\r\\n      ecstasy, calling for everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s congratulations, and laughing and\\r\\n      talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty\\r\\n      continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as\\r\\n      unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as\\r\\n      Lydia,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I\\r\\n      have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for\\r\\n      I am two years older.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to\\r\\n      make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was\\r\\n      so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother\\r\\n      and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all\\r\\n      possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as\\r\\n      such a step must make her were it known, she could not help\\r\\n      secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented\\r\\n      to him all the improprieties of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general behaviour, the\\r\\n      little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a\\r\\n      woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\r\\n      imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the\\r\\n      temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her\\r\\n      attentively, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\\r\\n      public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with\\r\\n      so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the\\r\\n      present circumstances.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you were aware,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof the very great\\r\\n      disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of\\r\\n      Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unguarded and imprudent manner\\xe2\\x80\\x94nay, which has already\\r\\n      arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the\\r\\n      affair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlready arisen?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Bennet. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat, has she frightened\\r\\n      away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast\\r\\n      down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a\\r\\n      little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the\\r\\n      list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      folly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It\\r\\n      is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now\\r\\n      complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must\\r\\n      be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of\\r\\n      all restraint which mark Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character. Excuse me, for I must\\r\\n      speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble\\r\\n      of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her\\r\\n      present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will\\r\\n      soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be\\r\\n      fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\r\\n      that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in\\r\\n      the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any\\r\\n      attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the\\r\\n      ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off\\r\\n      any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for\\r\\n      admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is\\r\\n      comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\\r\\n      ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father,\\r\\n      can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and\\r\\n      despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not\\r\\n      be often involved in the disgrace?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\r\\n      affectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are\\r\\n      known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear\\r\\n      to less advantage for having a couple of\\xe2\\x80\\x94or I may say, three\\xe2\\x80\\x94very\\r\\n      silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does\\r\\n      not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a\\r\\n      sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she\\r\\n      is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At\\r\\n      Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt\\r\\n      than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth\\r\\n      their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may\\r\\n      teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\\r\\n      many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the\\r\\n      rest of her life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own\\r\\n      opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and\\r\\n      sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her\\r\\n      vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having\\r\\n      performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or\\r\\n      augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference\\r\\n      with her father, their indignation would hardly have found\\r\\n      expression in their united volubility. In Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imagination, a\\r\\n      visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly\\r\\n      happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets\\r\\n      of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself\\r\\n      the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present\\r\\n      unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp\\xe2\\x80\\x94its tents stretched\\r\\n      forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\\r\\n      and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the\\r\\n      view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting\\r\\n      with at least six officers at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\\r\\n      and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?\\r\\n      They could have been understood only by her mother, who might\\r\\n      have felt nearly the same. Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to Brighton was all that\\r\\n      consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never\\r\\n      intending to go there himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their\\r\\n      raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of\\r\\n      Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaving home.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having\\r\\n      been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation\\r\\n      was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality\\r\\n      entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very\\r\\n      gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a\\r\\n      sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to\\r\\n      herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the\\r\\n      inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\r\\n      had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,\\r\\n      after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern\\r\\n      for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such\\r\\n      idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed\\r\\n      it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing,\\r\\n      that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had\\r\\n      been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference\\r\\n      secured at any time by their renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On the very last day of the regiment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remaining at Meryton, he\\r\\n      dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little\\r\\n      was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on\\r\\n      his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had\\r\\n      passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him,\\r\\n      if he was acquainted with the former.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly\\r\\n      seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very\\r\\n      gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer\\r\\n      was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon\\r\\n      afterwards added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow long did you say he was at Rosings?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNearly three weeks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you saw him frequently?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, almost every day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis manners are very different from his cousin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\\r\\n      acquaintance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd pray, may I ask?\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But checking himself, he added, in a\\r\\n      gayer tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to\\r\\n      add aught of civility to his ordinary style?\\xe2\\x80\\x94for I dare not\\r\\n      hope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued in a lower and more serious tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat he is\\r\\n      improved in essentials.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, no!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn essentials, I believe, he is very\\r\\n      much what he ever was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\\r\\n      rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\\r\\n      something in her countenance which made him listen with an\\r\\n      apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\\r\\n      that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but\\r\\n      that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better\\r\\n      understood.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\\r\\n      agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off\\r\\n      his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the\\r\\n      gentlest of accents:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\\r\\n      comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to\\r\\n      assume even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that\\r\\n      direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others,\\r\\n      for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have\\r\\n      suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which\\r\\n      you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his\\r\\n      visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands\\r\\n      much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when\\r\\n      they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish\\r\\n      of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain\\r\\n      he has very much at heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered\\r\\n      only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted\\r\\n      to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was\\r\\n      in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with\\r\\n      the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no\\r\\n      further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last\\r\\n      with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never\\r\\n      meeting again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\\r\\n      Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.\\r\\n      The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than\\r\\n      pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep\\r\\n      from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good\\r\\n      wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her\\r\\n      injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying\\r\\n      herself as much as possible\\xe2\\x80\\x94advice which there was every reason\\r\\n      to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous\\r\\n      happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle\\r\\n      adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 42\\r\\n\\r\\n      Had Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\\r\\n      could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal\\r\\n      felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and\\r\\n      beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty\\r\\n      generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and\\r\\n      illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all\\r\\n      real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had\\r\\n      vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were\\r\\n      overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek\\r\\n      comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had\\r\\n      brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the\\r\\n      unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the\\r\\n      country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his\\r\\n      principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise\\r\\n      indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his\\r\\n      amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in\\r\\n      general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of\\r\\n      entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive\\r\\n      benefit from such as are given.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of\\r\\n      her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with\\r\\n      pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his\\r\\n      affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what\\r\\n      she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that\\r\\n      continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in\\r\\n      exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so\\r\\n      highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now\\r\\n      the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable\\r\\n      a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\\r\\n      from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which,\\r\\n      rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of\\r\\n      his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his\\r\\n      wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure she found\\r\\n      little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.\\r\\n      Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home\\r\\n      she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the\\r\\n      dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their\\r\\n      domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her\\r\\n      natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were\\r\\n      removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil\\r\\n      might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly\\r\\n      and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\r\\n      watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found,\\r\\n      what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she\\r\\n      had looked forward with impatient desire did not, in taking\\r\\n      place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It\\r\\n      was consequently necessary to name some other period for the\\r\\n      commencement of actual felicity\\xe2\\x80\\x94to have some other point on which\\r\\n      her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the\\r\\n      pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and\\r\\n      prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now\\r\\n      the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\\r\\n      for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her\\r\\n      mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included\\r\\n      Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it is fortunate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I have something to\\r\\n      wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment\\r\\n      would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless\\r\\n      source of regret in my sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absence, I may reasonably hope to\\r\\n      have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which\\r\\n      every part promises delight can never be successful; and general\\r\\n      disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little\\r\\n      peculiar vexation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very\\r\\n      minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always\\r\\n      long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother\\r\\n      contained little else than that they were just returned from the\\r\\n      library, where such and such officers had attended them, and\\r\\n      where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite\\r\\n      wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would\\r\\n      have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\\r\\n      violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going\\r\\n      off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister,\\r\\n      there was still less to be learnt\\xe2\\x80\\x94for her letters to Kitty,\\r\\n      though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words\\r\\n      to be made public.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\r\\n      good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\r\\n      Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in\\r\\n      town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer\\r\\n      engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual\\r\\n      querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much\\r\\n      recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event\\r\\n      of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the\\r\\n      following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not\\r\\n      to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and\\r\\n      malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should\\r\\n      be quartered in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\\r\\n      fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a\\r\\n      letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its\\r\\n      commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be\\r\\n      prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in\\r\\n      July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that\\r\\n      left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as\\r\\n      they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and\\r\\n      comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the\\r\\n      Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to\\r\\n      the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than\\r\\n      Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy\\r\\n      the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a\\r\\n      peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly\\r\\n      passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a\\r\\n      few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all\\r\\n      the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the\\r\\n      Peak.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\\r\\n      seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time\\r\\n      enough. But it was her business to be satisfied\\xe2\\x80\\x94and certainly her\\r\\n      temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.\\r\\n      It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of\\r\\n      Pemberley and its owner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut surely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI may enter his\\r\\n      county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without\\r\\n      his perceiving me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to\\r\\n      pass away before her uncle and aunt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arrival. But they did pass\\r\\n      away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at\\r\\n      length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and\\r\\n      eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the\\r\\n      particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general\\r\\n      favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly\\r\\n      adapted her for attending to them in every way\\xe2\\x80\\x94teaching them,\\r\\n      playing with them, and loving them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\\r\\n      next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\\r\\n      One enjoyment was certain\\xe2\\x80\\x94that of suitableness of companions; a\\r\\n      suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\\r\\n      inconveniences\\xe2\\x80\\x94cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\n      affection and intelligence, which might supply it among\\r\\n      themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It is not the object of this work to give a description of\\r\\n      Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which\\r\\n      their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,\\r\\n      Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of\\r\\n      Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of\\r\\n      Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former residence, and where\\r\\n      she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they\\r\\n      bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of\\r\\n      the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found\\r\\n      from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their\\r\\n      direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking\\r\\n      over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\\r\\n      inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\\r\\n      willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\\r\\n      heard so much?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her aunt; \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca place, too, with which so many\\r\\n      of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth\\r\\n      there, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\\r\\n      Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\\r\\n      it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\\r\\n      going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\\r\\n      satin curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it were merely a fine\\r\\n      house richly furnished,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should not care about it\\r\\n      myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the\\r\\n      finest woods in the country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth said no more\\xe2\\x80\\x94but her mind could not acquiesce. The\\r\\n      possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\\r\\n      instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very\\r\\n      idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt\\r\\n      than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;\\r\\n      and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if\\r\\n      her private enquiries to the absence of the family were\\r\\n      unfavourably answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\\r\\n      whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name\\r\\n      of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family\\r\\n      were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the\\r\\n      last question\\xe2\\x80\\x94and her alarms now being removed, she was at\\r\\n      leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house\\r\\n      herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and\\r\\n      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper\\r\\n      air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the\\r\\n      scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 43\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\\r\\n      of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length\\r\\n      they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\r\\n      They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\\r\\n      time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\\r\\n      admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually\\r\\n      ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of\\r\\n      a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was\\r\\n      instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite\\r\\n      side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.\\r\\n      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising\\r\\n      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,\\r\\n      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but\\r\\n      without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal\\r\\n      nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen\\r\\n      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty\\r\\n      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\\r\\n      all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt\\r\\n      that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\r\\n\\r\\n      They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\\r\\n      door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all\\r\\n      her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest\\r\\n      the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,\\r\\n      they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited\\r\\n      for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she\\r\\n      was.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much\\r\\n      less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding\\r\\n      her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,\\r\\n      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after\\r\\n      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.\\r\\n      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving\\r\\n      increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.\\r\\n      Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the\\r\\n      whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the\\r\\n      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with\\r\\n      delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were\\r\\n      taking different positions; but from every window there were\\r\\n      beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their\\r\\n      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but\\r\\n      Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither\\r\\n      gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real\\r\\n      elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd of this place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI might have been mistress!\\r\\n      With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\r\\n      Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in\\r\\n      them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and\\r\\n      aunt. But no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94recollecting herself\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat could never be; my\\r\\n      uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been\\r\\n      allowed to invite them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was a lucky recollection\\xe2\\x80\\x94it saved her from something very\\r\\n      like regret.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was\\r\\n      really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,\\r\\n      the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with\\r\\n      alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut we\\r\\n      expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d How\\r\\n      rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any\\r\\n      circumstance been delayed a day!\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and\\r\\n      saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\\r\\n      miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly,\\r\\n      how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it\\r\\n      was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\r\\n      is now gone into the army,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I am afraid he has\\r\\n      turned out very wild.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth\\r\\n      could not return it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\\r\\n      miniatures, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis my master\\xe2\\x80\\x94and very like him. It was drawn at the\\r\\n      same time as the other\\xe2\\x80\\x94about eight years ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have heard much of your master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine person,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner, looking at the picture; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is a handsome face. But,\\r\\n      Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\r\\n      intimation of her knowing her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth coloured, and said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA little.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very handsome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up\\r\\n      stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\r\\n      This room was my late master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite room, and these\\r\\n      miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of\\r\\n      them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being among them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,\\r\\n      drawn when she was only eight years old.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes\\xe2\\x80\\x94the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\\r\\n      accomplished!\\xe2\\x80\\x94She plays and sings all day long. In the next room\\r\\n      is a new instrument just come down for her\\xe2\\x80\\x94a present from my\\r\\n      master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,\\r\\n      encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks;\\r\\n      Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great\\r\\n      pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend\\r\\n      half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer\\r\\n      months.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcept,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen she goes to Ramsgate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf your master would marry, you might see more of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know\\r\\n      who is good enough for him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think\\r\\n      so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows\\r\\n      him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty\\r\\n      far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the\\r\\n      housekeeper added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have never known a cross word from him in\\r\\n      my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\\r\\n      to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her\\r\\n      firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed\\r\\n      to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are\\r\\n      lucky in having such a master.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I\\r\\n      could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that\\r\\n      they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when\\r\\n      they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most\\r\\n      generous-hearted boy in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth almost stared at her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan this be Mr. Darcy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought\\r\\n      she.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis father was an excellent man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like\\r\\n      him\\xe2\\x80\\x94just as affable to the poor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\\r\\n      more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She\\r\\n      related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the\\r\\n      rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\n      highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he\\r\\n      attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led\\r\\n      again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many\\r\\n      merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is the best landlord, and the best master,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\n      ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of\\r\\n      nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or\\r\\n      servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him\\r\\n      proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it\\r\\n      is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn what an amiable light does this place him!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis fine account of him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whispered her aunt as they walked,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps we might be deceived.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is not very likely; our authority was too good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very\\r\\n      pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and\\r\\n      lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it\\r\\n      was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a\\r\\n      liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is certainly a good brother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, as she walked\\r\\n      towards one of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delight, when she should\\r\\n      enter the room. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd this is always the way with him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in\\r\\n      a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\\r\\n      were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good\\r\\n      paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such\\r\\n      as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to\\r\\n      look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, in crayons, whose subjects\\r\\n      were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could\\r\\n      have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked\\r\\n      in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\r\\n      At last it arrested her\\xe2\\x80\\x94and she beheld a striking resemblance to\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to\\r\\n      have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several\\r\\n      minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and\\r\\n      returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs.\\r\\n      Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\n      There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind, a more\\r\\n      gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\\r\\n      the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on\\r\\n      him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is\\r\\n      more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a\\r\\n      brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      happiness were in his guardianship!\\xe2\\x80\\x94how much of pleasure or pain\\r\\n      was it in his power to bestow!\\xe2\\x80\\x94how much of good or evil must be\\r\\n      done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the\\r\\n      housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood\\r\\n      before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes\\r\\n      upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment\\r\\n      of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its\\r\\n      warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When all of the house that was open to general inspection had\\r\\n      been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\\r\\n      housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at\\r\\n      the hall-door.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\\r\\n      turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\\r\\n      while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\\r\\n      the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\\r\\n      which led behind it to the stables.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\\r\\n      his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their\\r\\n      eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\\r\\n      the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed\\r\\n      immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced\\r\\n      towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of\\r\\n      perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\r\\n      received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\\r\\n      overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the\\r\\n      picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure\\r\\n      the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately\\r\\n      have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to\\r\\n      their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift\\r\\n      her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to\\r\\n      his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of\\r\\n      his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered\\r\\n      was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\\r\\n      impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the\\r\\n      few minutes in which they continued were some of the most\\r\\n      uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;\\r\\n      when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and\\r\\n      he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left\\r\\n      Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so\\r\\n      hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\\r\\n      few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\\r\\n      himself, and took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\\r\\n      figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by\\r\\n      her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered\\r\\n      by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,\\r\\n      the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must\\r\\n      appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so\\r\\n      vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself\\r\\n      in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come\\r\\n      a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\\r\\n      sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\\r\\n      discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment\\r\\n      arrived\\xe2\\x80\\x94that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She\\r\\n      blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And\\r\\n      his behaviour, so strikingly altered\\xe2\\x80\\x94what could it mean? That he\\r\\n      should even speak to her was amazing!\\xe2\\x80\\x94but to speak with such\\r\\n      civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she\\r\\n      seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with\\r\\n      such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast\\r\\n      did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his\\r\\n      letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\\r\\n      account for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\\r\\n      and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a\\r\\n      finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it\\r\\n      was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\\r\\n      though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her\\r\\n      uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as\\r\\n      they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her\\r\\n      thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,\\r\\n      whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to\\r\\n      know what at the moment was passing in his mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94in what manner he\\r\\n      thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was\\r\\n      still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt\\r\\n      himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\\r\\n      not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\\r\\n      seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her\\r\\n      with composure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence\\r\\n      of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more\\r\\n      like herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\\r\\n      while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where\\r\\n      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many\\r\\n      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long\\r\\n      range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the\\r\\n      stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole\\r\\n      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant\\r\\n      smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the\\r\\n      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought\\r\\n      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to\\r\\n      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They\\r\\n      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air\\r\\n      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet\\r\\n      visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed\\r\\n      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough\\r\\n      coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its\\r\\n      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived\\r\\n      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great\\r\\n      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the\\r\\n      carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\\r\\n      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on\\r\\n      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but\\r\\n      their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to\\r\\n      indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much\\r\\n      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in\\r\\n      the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced\\r\\n      but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were\\r\\n      again surprised, and Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s astonishment was quite equal to\\r\\n      what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching\\r\\n      them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\\r\\n      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\r\\n      they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\\r\\n      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and\\r\\n      to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a\\r\\n      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into\\r\\n      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk\\r\\n      concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was\\r\\n      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost\\r\\n      none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she\\r\\n      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she\\r\\n      had not got beyond the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelightful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccharming,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when\\r\\n      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise\\r\\n      of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her\\r\\n      colour changed, and she said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\\r\\n      he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to\\r\\n      her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was\\r\\n      quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\\r\\n      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people\\r\\n      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat will be his surprise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen he knows who they\\r\\n      are? He takes them now for people of fashion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named\\r\\n      their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to\\r\\n      see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his\\r\\n      decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.\\r\\n      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he\\r\\n      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going\\r\\n      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but\\r\\n      triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\\r\\n      relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\\r\\n      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\\r\\n      expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his\\r\\n      intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as\\r\\n      often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,\\r\\n      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and\\r\\n      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually\\r\\n      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\\r\\n      Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said\\r\\n      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be\\r\\n      all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\\r\\n      continually was she repeating, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy is he so altered? From what\\r\\n      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_\\xe2\\x80\\x94it cannot be for _my_ sake\\r\\n      that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could\\r\\n      not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should\\r\\n      still love me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\\r\\n      two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending\\r\\n      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some\\r\\n      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It\\r\\n      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the\\r\\n      morning, found Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm inadequate to her support, and\\r\\n      consequently preferred her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Mr. Darcy took her place by\\r\\n      her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,\\r\\n      the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been\\r\\n      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and\\r\\n      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very\\r\\n      unexpected\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor your housekeeper,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinformed us that\\r\\n      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,\\r\\n      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not\\r\\n      immediately expected in the country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He acknowledged the truth\\r\\n      of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned\\r\\n      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\\r\\n      whom he had been travelling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey will join me early to-morrow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand among them are some who will claim an\\r\\n      acquaintance with you\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were\\r\\n      instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name had\\r\\n      been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by\\r\\n      his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is also one other person in the party,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued after\\r\\n      a pause, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will\\r\\n      you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to\\r\\n      your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\\r\\n      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She\\r\\n      immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\\r\\n      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\\r\\n      without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying\\r\\n      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of\\r\\n      her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\r\\n      Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\\r\\n      flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her\\r\\n      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\\r\\n      others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then asked her to walk into the house\\xe2\\x80\\x94but she declared herself\\r\\n      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time\\r\\n      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She\\r\\n      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every\\r\\n      subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,\\r\\n      and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.\\r\\n      Yet time and her aunt moved slowly\\xe2\\x80\\x94and her patience and her ideas\\r\\n      were nearly worn out before the _t\\xc3\\xaate-\\xc3\\xa0-t\\xc3\\xaate_ was over.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming up they were all pressed to go\\r\\n      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,\\r\\n      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,\\r\\n      Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\\r\\n      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\\r\\n      had expected. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\\r\\n      unassuming,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      replied her aunt, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it is confined to his air, and is not\\r\\n      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some\\r\\n      people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was\\r\\n      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\\r\\n      necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was\\r\\n      very trifling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, Lizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her aunt, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che is not so handsome as\\r\\n      Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s countenance, for his\\r\\n      features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he\\r\\n      was so disagreeable?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\\r\\n      liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\\r\\n      she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      replied her uncle. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour great men often are; and therefore I\\r\\n      shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\\r\\n      another day, and warn me off his grounds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his\\r\\n      character, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom what we have seen of him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Gardiner, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\n      really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\\r\\n      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not\\r\\n      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing\\r\\n      about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity\\r\\n      in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea\\r\\n      of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his\\r\\n      house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help\\r\\n      laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,\\r\\n      and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\\r\\n      vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them\\r\\n      to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what\\r\\n      she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were\\r\\n      capable of a very different construction; and that his character\\r\\n      was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so amiable, as they had\\r\\n      been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she\\r\\n      related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in\\r\\n      which they had been connected, without actually naming her\\r\\n      authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\\r\\n      approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave\\r\\n      way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in\\r\\n      pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its\\r\\n      environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by\\r\\n      the morning\\xe2\\x80\\x99s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off\\r\\n      again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was\\r\\n      spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many\\r\\n      years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 discontinuance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave\\r\\n      Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she\\r\\n      could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted\\r\\n      with his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 44\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to\\r\\n      visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was\\r\\n      consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole\\r\\n      of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very\\r\\n      morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They\\r\\n      had been walking about the place with some of their new friends,\\r\\n      and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining\\r\\n      with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a\\r\\n      window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving\\r\\n      up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery,\\r\\n      guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\\r\\n      surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour\\r\\n      which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and\\r\\n      the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the\\r\\n      circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the\\r\\n      preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing\\r\\n      had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no\\r\\n      other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter\\r\\n      than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\\r\\n      newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation\\r\\n      of Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was\\r\\n      quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of\\r\\n      disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should\\r\\n      have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious\\r\\n      to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing\\r\\n      would fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\\r\\n      walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw\\r\\n      such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made\\r\\n      everything worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\\r\\n      introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that\\r\\n      her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.\\r\\n      Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was\\r\\n      exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes\\r\\n      convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it\\r\\n      difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\\r\\n      though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\\r\\n      appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her\\r\\n      brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her\\r\\n      manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had\\r\\n      expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as\\r\\n      ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such\\r\\n      different feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\\r\\n      Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\\r\\n      to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\\r\\n      Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\\r\\n      entered the room. All Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anger against him had been long\\r\\n      done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood\\r\\n      its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\\r\\n      expressed himself on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly,\\r\\n      though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\\r\\n      the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\\r\\n      personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The\\r\\n      whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The\\r\\n      suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece\\r\\n      directed their observation towards each with an earnest though\\r\\n      guarded enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full\\r\\n      conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of\\r\\n      the lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that\\r\\n      the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain\\r\\n      the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her\\r\\n      own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter\\r\\n      object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of\\r\\n      success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were\\r\\n      prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was\\r\\n      eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;\\r\\n      and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his\\r\\n      were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he\\r\\n      talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\\r\\n      herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying\\r\\n      to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she\\r\\n      could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had\\r\\n      been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side\\r\\n      that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that\\r\\n      could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon\\r\\n      satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere\\r\\n      they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\\r\\n      recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\\r\\n      saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.\\r\\n      He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking\\r\\n      together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that\\r\\n      it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing\\r\\n      her;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and, before she could reply, he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is above eight\\r\\n      months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were\\r\\n      all dancing together at Netherfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\\r\\n      afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of\\r\\n      the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was\\r\\n      not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there\\r\\n      was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\\r\\n      expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\\r\\n      heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his\\r\\n      companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners\\r\\n      which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence\\r\\n      might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus\\r\\n      seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people\\r\\n      with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\\r\\n      disgrace\\xe2\\x80\\x94when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to\\r\\n      the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\\r\\n      their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage\\xe2\\x80\\x94the difference, the\\r\\n      change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she\\r\\n      could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never,\\r\\n      even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his\\r\\n      dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to\\r\\n      please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as\\r\\n      now, when no importance could result from the success of his\\r\\n      endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his\\r\\n      attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and\\r\\n      censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they\\r\\n      arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in\\r\\n      expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss\\r\\n      Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.\\r\\n      Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in\\r\\n      the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner\\r\\n      looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the\\r\\n      invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance,\\r\\n      but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that\\r\\n      this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment\\r\\n      than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who\\r\\n      was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she\\r\\n      ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next\\r\\n      was fixed on.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\\r\\n      Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and\\r\\n      many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.\\r\\n      Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak\\r\\n      of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some\\r\\n      others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of\\r\\n      considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though\\r\\n      while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager\\r\\n      to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and\\r\\n      aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\\r\\n      favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s curiosity;\\r\\n      it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident\\r\\n      that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had\\r\\n      before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love\\r\\n      with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify\\r\\n      enquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,\\r\\n      as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\r\\n      They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn\\r\\n      his character from their own feelings and his servant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report,\\r\\n      without any reference to any other account, the circle in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it\\r\\n      for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing\\r\\n      the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority\\r\\n      of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and\\r\\n      whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily\\r\\n      rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\\r\\n      their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.\\r\\n      They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably\\r\\n      had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants\\r\\n      of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was\\r\\n      acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much\\r\\n      good among the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was\\r\\n      not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his\\r\\n      concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood,\\r\\n      it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he\\r\\n      had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards\\r\\n      discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening\\r\\n      more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it\\r\\n      seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings\\r\\n      towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours\\r\\n      endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him.\\r\\n      No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been\\r\\n      ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so\\r\\n      called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable\\r\\n      qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\\r\\n      time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now\\r\\n      heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony\\r\\n      so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in\\r\\n      so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,\\r\\n      above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of\\r\\n      goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;\\r\\n      gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving\\r\\n      her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony\\r\\n      of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\\r\\n      accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would\\r\\n      avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental\\r\\n      meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any\\r\\n      indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where\\r\\n      their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\\r\\n      opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his\\r\\n      sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only\\r\\n      astonishment but gratitude\\xe2\\x80\\x94for to love, ardent love, it must be\\r\\n      attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be\\r\\n      encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\\r\\n      exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to\\r\\n      him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted\\r\\n      to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself,\\r\\n      and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should\\r\\n      employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed,\\r\\n      of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the\\r\\n      niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in coming to\\r\\n      see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had\\r\\n      reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though\\r\\n      it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their\\r\\n      side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to\\r\\n      wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were,\\r\\n      therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked\\r\\n      herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme\\r\\n      had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made\\r\\n      of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 45\\r\\n\\r\\n      Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dislike of her\\r\\n      had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\\r\\n      unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was\\r\\n      curious to know with how much civility on that lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side the\\r\\n      acquaintance would now be renewed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the\\r\\n      saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.\\r\\n      Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing\\r\\n      view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the\\r\\n      beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over\\r\\n      the intermediate lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting\\r\\n      there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom\\r\\n      she lived in London. Georgiana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reception of them was very\\r\\n      civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though\\r\\n      proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily\\r\\n      give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her\\r\\n      being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however,\\r\\n      did her justice, and pitied her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\\r\\n      curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\\r\\n      pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first\\r\\n      broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman,\\r\\n      whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to\\r\\n      be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between\\r\\n      her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the\\r\\n      conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished\\r\\n      for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\\r\\n      short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\\r\\n      Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\\r\\n      Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not\\r\\n      have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they\\r\\n      not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not\\r\\n      sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts\\r\\n      were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the\\r\\n      gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the\\r\\n      master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished\\r\\n      or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in\\r\\n      this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry\\r\\n      after the health of her family. She answered with equal\\r\\n      indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\\r\\n      entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all\\r\\n      the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till\\r\\n      after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to\\r\\n      Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was\\r\\n      now employment for the whole party\\xe2\\x80\\x94for though they could not all\\r\\n      talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,\\r\\n      nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n      While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\\r\\n      whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\\r\\n      and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes\\r\\n      to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three\\r\\n      other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had\\r\\n      left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended\\r\\n      a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than\\r\\n      Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;\\r\\n      a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the\\r\\n      more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the\\r\\n      whole party were awakened against them, and that there was\\r\\n      scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first\\r\\n      came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so\\r\\n      strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, in spite of the smiles\\r\\n      which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\\r\\n      objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her\\r\\n      attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her\\r\\n      brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and\\r\\n      Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to\\r\\n      get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt\\r\\n      at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this\\r\\n      likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first\\r\\n      opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray, Miss Eliza, are not the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire Militia removed from\\r\\n      Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      In Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name; but\\r\\n      Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her\\r\\n      thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave\\r\\n      her a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel\\r\\n      the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a\\r\\n      tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance\\r\\n      showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking\\r\\n      at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to\\r\\n      lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then\\r\\n      giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained\\r\\n      from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\\r\\n      Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she\\r\\n      believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which\\r\\n      might injure her in Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the\\r\\n      latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of\\r\\n      her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had\\r\\n      ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meditated elopement. To no\\r\\n      creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except\\r\\n      to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connections her brother was\\r\\n      particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which\\r\\n      Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\\r\\n      hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and\\r\\n      without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate\\r\\n      him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something\\r\\n      to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\\r\\n      emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not\\r\\n      approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,\\r\\n      though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother,\\r\\n      whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest\\r\\n      in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed\\r\\n      to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on\\r\\n      her more and more cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer\\r\\n      above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their\\r\\n      carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not\\r\\n      join her. Her brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recommendation was enough to ensure her\\r\\n      favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such\\r\\n      terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of\\r\\n      finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy\\r\\n      returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\\r\\n      him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      she cried; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\\r\\n      is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and\\r\\n      I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\\r\\n      contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other\\r\\n      alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\\r\\n      consequence of travelling in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor my own part,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she rejoined, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must confess that I never\\r\\n      could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion\\r\\n      has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her\\r\\n      nose wants character\\xe2\\x80\\x94there is nothing marked in its lines. Her\\r\\n      teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for\\r\\n      her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never\\r\\n      see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish\\r\\n      look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there\\r\\n      is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this\\r\\n      was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people\\r\\n      are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat\\r\\n      nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely\\r\\n      silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak,\\r\\n      she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed\\r\\n      we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\\r\\n      particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\\r\\n      dining at Netherfield, \\xe2\\x80\\x98_She_ a beauty!\\xe2\\x80\\x94I should as soon call her\\r\\n      mother a wit.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I\\r\\n      believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\n      _that_ was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since\\r\\n      I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my\\r\\n      acquaintance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\\r\\n      satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\\r\\n      pain but herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred\\r\\n      during their visit, as they returned, except what had\\r\\n      particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of\\r\\n      everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who\\r\\n      had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister,\\r\\n      his friends, his house, his fruit\\xe2\\x80\\x94of everything but himself; yet\\r\\n      Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him,\\r\\n      and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      beginning the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 46\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a\\r\\n      letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this\\r\\n      disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had\\r\\n      now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and\\r\\n      her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at\\r\\n      once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent\\r\\n      elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written\\r\\n      the direction remarkably ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and\\r\\n      her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off\\r\\n      by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had\\r\\n      been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of\\r\\n      all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the\\r\\n      country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day\\r\\n      later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important\\r\\n      intelligence. It was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\\r\\n      of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of\\r\\n      alarming you\\xe2\\x80\\x94be assured that we are all well. What I have to say\\r\\n      relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just\\r\\n      as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us\\r\\n      that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to\\r\\n      own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty,\\r\\n      however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very\\r\\n      sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to\\r\\n      hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\\r\\n      Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this\\r\\n      step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His\\r\\n      choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can\\r\\n      give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father\\r\\n      bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know\\r\\n      what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They\\r\\n      were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were\\r\\n      not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent\\r\\n      off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten\\r\\n      miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here\\r\\n      soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their\\r\\n      intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\\r\\n      mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I\\r\\n      hardly know what I have written.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\\r\\n      knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter\\r\\n      instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost\\r\\n      impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than\\r\\n      the conclusion of the first.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\\r\\n      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\\r\\n      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\\r\\n      for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\\r\\n      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\r\\n      Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia\\r\\n      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place,\\r\\n      for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to\\r\\n      Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton\\r\\n      the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were\\r\\n      going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing\\r\\n      his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia\\r\\n      at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking\\r\\n      the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did\\r\\n      trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering\\r\\n      that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the\\r\\n      chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this\\r\\n      is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not\\r\\n      what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side\\r\\n      London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing\\r\\n      them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and\\r\\n      Hatfield, but without any success\\xe2\\x80\\x94no such people had been seen to\\r\\n      pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,\\r\\n      and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to\\r\\n      his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one\\r\\n      can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very\\r\\n      great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think\\r\\n      so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for\\r\\n      them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first\\r\\n      plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young\\r\\n      woman of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\\r\\n      her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,\\r\\n      that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he\\r\\n      shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.\\r\\n      was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and\\r\\n      keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but\\r\\n      this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my\\r\\n      life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having\\r\\n      concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,\\r\\n      one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have\\r\\n      been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as\\r\\n      the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?\\r\\n      I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\\r\\n      inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have\\r\\n      just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I\\r\\n      cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as\\r\\n      possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\r\\n      afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\\r\\n      ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\\r\\n      Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I\\r\\n      am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him\\r\\n      to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel\\r\\n      Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In\\r\\n      such an exigence, my uncle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice and assistance would be\\r\\n      everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I\\r\\n      must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! where, where is my uncle?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, darting from her\\r\\n      seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,\\r\\n      without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she\\r\\n      reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and\\r\\n      before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind\\r\\n      every idea was superseded by Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation, hastily\\r\\n      exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I\\r\\n      have not an instant to lose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood God! what is the matter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he, with more feeling than\\r\\n      politeness; then recollecting himself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not detain you a\\r\\n      minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she\\r\\n      felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\r\\n      Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though\\r\\n      in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to\\r\\n      fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself,\\r\\n      and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to\\r\\n      leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and\\r\\n      commiseration, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me call your maid. Is there nothing you could\\r\\n      take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you\\r\\n      one? You are very ill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I thank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only\\r\\n      distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from\\r\\n      Longbourn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes\\r\\n      could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could\\r\\n      only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her\\r\\n      in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have just\\r\\n      had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be\\r\\n      concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her\\r\\n      friends\\xe2\\x80\\x94has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of\\xe2\\x80\\x94of Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him\\r\\n      too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,\\r\\n      nothing that can tempt him to\\xe2\\x80\\x94she is lost for ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy was fixed in astonishment. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I consider,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added in\\r\\n      a yet more agitated voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat _I_ might have prevented it! _I_\\r\\n      who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it\\r\\n      only\\xe2\\x80\\x94some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his\\r\\n      character been known, this could not have happened. But it is\\r\\n      all\\xe2\\x80\\x94all too late now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am grieved indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Darcy; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrieved\\xe2\\x80\\x94shocked. But is it\\r\\n      certain\\xe2\\x80\\x94absolutely certain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were\\r\\n      traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not\\r\\n      gone to Scotland.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\\r\\n      her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my\\r\\n      uncle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in\\r\\n      half-an-hour. But nothing can be done\\xe2\\x80\\x94I know very well that\\r\\n      nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are\\r\\n      they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is\\r\\n      every way horrible!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen _my_ eyes were opened to his real character\\xe2\\x80\\x94Oh! had I known\\r\\n      what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not\\xe2\\x80\\x94I was afraid of\\r\\n      doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was\\r\\n      walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow\\r\\n      contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and\\r\\n      instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything _must_\\r\\n      sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of\\r\\n      the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but\\r\\n      the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to\\r\\n      her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the\\r\\n      contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\\r\\n      wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have\\r\\n      loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.\\r\\n      Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x94the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all,\\r\\n      soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with\\r\\n      her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else;\\r\\n      and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a\\r\\n      sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a\\r\\n      manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise\\r\\n      restraint, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid you have been long desiring my\\r\\n      absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but\\r\\n      real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\\r\\n      could be either said or done on my part that might offer\\r\\n      consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with\\r\\n      vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\\r\\n      This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having\\r\\n      the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say\\r\\n      that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the\\r\\n      unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be\\r\\n      long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow\\r\\n      for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was\\r\\n      at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her\\r\\n      relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that\\r\\n      they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality\\r\\n      as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she\\r\\n      threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their\\r\\n      acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at\\r\\n      the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted\\r\\n      its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its\\r\\n      termination.\\r\\n\\r\\n      If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor\\r\\n      faulty. But if otherwise\\xe2\\x80\\x94if regard springing from such sources is\\r\\n      unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often\\r\\n      described as arising on a first interview with its object, and\\r\\n      even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in\\r\\n      her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the\\r\\n      latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill\\r\\n      success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less\\r\\n      interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\\r\\n      with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infamy\\r\\n      must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that\\r\\n      wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second letter, had\\r\\n      she entertained a hope of Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meaning to marry her. No one\\r\\n      but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an\\r\\n      expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this\\r\\n      development. While the contents of the first letter remained in\\r\\n      her mind, she was all surprise\\xe2\\x80\\x94all astonishment that Wickham\\r\\n      should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for\\r\\n      money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\\r\\n      incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an\\r\\n      attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though\\r\\n      she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an\\r\\n      elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no\\r\\n      difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her\\r\\n      understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,\\r\\n      that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that\\r\\n      Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.\\r\\n      Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite,\\r\\n      as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections\\r\\n      had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The\\r\\n      mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a\\r\\n      girl\\xe2\\x80\\x94oh! how acutely did she now feel it!\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was wild to be at home\\xe2\\x80\\x94to hear, to see, to be upon the spot\\r\\n      to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon\\r\\n      her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable\\r\\n      of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost\\r\\n      persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered\\r\\n      the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had\\r\\n      hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account that\\r\\n      their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly\\r\\n      on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\\r\\n      summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the\\r\\n      postscript of the last with trembling energy.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Though Lydia had\\r\\n      never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not\\r\\n      but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned\\r\\n      in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror,\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth,\\r\\n      though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude;\\r\\n      and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating\\r\\n      to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as\\r\\n      soon as possible. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what is to be done about Pemberley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\\r\\n      us; was it so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\\r\\n      engagement. _That_ is all settled.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is all settled;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated the other, as she ran into her\\r\\n      room to prepare. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd are they upon such terms as for her to\\r\\n      disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her\\r\\n      in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth\\r\\n      been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that\\r\\n      all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but\\r\\n      she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst\\r\\n      the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at\\r\\n      Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour,\\r\\n      however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile\\r\\n      having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be\\r\\n      done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the\\r\\n      morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\\r\\n      have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to\\r\\n      Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 47\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her uncle,\\r\\n      as they drove from the town; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand really, upon serious\\r\\n      consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\\r\\n      your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very\\r\\n      unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a\\r\\n      girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was\\r\\n      actually staying in his colonel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family, that I am strongly\\r\\n      inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would\\r\\n      not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\\r\\n      regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His\\r\\n      temptation is not adequate to the risk!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you really think so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\\r\\n      moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Gardiner, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI begin to be of your\\r\\n      uncle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,\\r\\n      honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so\\r\\n      very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him\\r\\n      up, as to believe him capable of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\r\\n      neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so!\\r\\n      But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if\\r\\n      that had been the case?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the first place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Gardiner, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is no absolute\\r\\n      proof that they are not gone to Scotland.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\\r\\n      such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be\\r\\n      found on the Barnet road.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then\\xe2\\x80\\x94supposing them to be in London. They may be there,\\r\\n      though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\\r\\n      purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\\r\\n      either side; and it might strike them that they could be more\\r\\n      economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than\\r\\n      in Scotland.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must\\r\\n      their marriage be private? Oh, no, no\\xe2\\x80\\x94this is not likely. His\\r\\n      most particular friend, you see by Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account, was persuaded\\r\\n      of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a\\r\\n      woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims\\r\\n      has Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x94what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good\\r\\n      humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of\\r\\n      benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the\\r\\n      apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\\r\\n      dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I\\r\\n      know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But\\r\\n      as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.\\r\\n      Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from\\r\\n      my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behaviour, from his indolence and the little\\r\\n      attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in\\r\\n      his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little\\r\\n      about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\\r\\n      of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\\r\\n      marriage?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\n      Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat a sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sense of\\r\\n      decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,\\r\\n      really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her\\r\\n      justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to\\r\\n      think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\\r\\n      twelvemonth\\xe2\\x80\\x94she has been given up to nothing but amusement and\\r\\n      vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most\\r\\n      idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in\\r\\n      her way. Since the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire were first quartered in Meryton,\\r\\n      nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head.\\r\\n      She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and\\r\\n      talking on the subject, to give greater\\xe2\\x80\\x94what shall I call it?\\r\\n      susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively\\r\\n      enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person\\r\\n      and address that can captivate a woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you see that Jane,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her aunt, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes not think so very\\r\\n      ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever\\r\\n      might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\\r\\n      such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane\\r\\n      knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that\\r\\n      he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has\\r\\n      neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful\\r\\n      as he is insinuating.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd do you really know all this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\\r\\n      curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, colouring. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told you, the\\r\\n      other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\\r\\n      yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke\\r\\n      of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality\\r\\n      towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at\\r\\n      liberty\\xe2\\x80\\x94which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about\\r\\n      the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss\\r\\n      Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,\\r\\n      disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must\\r\\n      know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\\r\\n      her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what\\r\\n      you and Jane seem so well to understand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x94that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and\\r\\n      saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I\\r\\n      returned home, the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\\r\\n      fortnight\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I\\r\\n      related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\\r\\n      knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\\r\\n      one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him\\r\\n      should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that\\r\\n      Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her\\r\\n      eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\\r\\n      in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such\\r\\n      a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was\\r\\n      far enough from my thoughts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason,\\r\\n      I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on\\r\\n      either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\\r\\n      must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\\r\\n      thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready\\r\\n      enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near\\r\\n      Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months;\\r\\n      but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention;\\r\\n      and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\\r\\n      wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the\\r\\n      regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her\\r\\n      favourites.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could\\r\\n      be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this\\r\\n      interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could\\r\\n      detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the\\r\\n      keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval\\r\\n      of ease or forgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\\r\\n      night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.\\r\\n      It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not\\r\\n      have been wearied by long expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\\r\\n      standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\\r\\n      and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\\r\\n      that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their\\r\\n      whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first\\r\\n      pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\\r\\n      kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\\r\\n      down from her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apartment, immediately met her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears\\r\\n      filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether\\r\\n      anything had been heard of the fugitives.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Jane. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut now that my dear uncle is come, I\\r\\n      hope everything will be well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs my father in town?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd have you heard from him often?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday\\r\\n      to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his\\r\\n      directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely\\r\\n      added that he should not write again till he had something of\\r\\n      importance to mention.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd my mother\\xe2\\x80\\x94how is she? How are you all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\\r\\n      greatly shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction\\r\\n      in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary\\r\\n      and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you\\xe2\\x80\\x94how are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou look pale. How much\\r\\n      you must have gone through!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\\r\\n      their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to\\r\\n      by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and\\r\\n      aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles\\r\\n      and tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\\r\\n      Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\\r\\n      others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to\\r\\n      give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence\\r\\n      of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still\\r\\n      expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would\\r\\n      bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain\\r\\n      their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\\r\\n      minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 conversation together, received them exactly as might be\\r\\n      expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\\r\\n      against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her\\r\\n      own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to\\r\\n      whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must\\r\\n      principally be owing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I had been able,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto carry my point in going to\\r\\n      Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but\\r\\n      poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the\\r\\n      Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was\\r\\n      some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\\r\\n      kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked\\r\\n      after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge\\r\\n      of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And\\r\\n      now here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\r\\n      Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\\r\\n      what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out\\r\\n      before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\\r\\n      brother, I do not know what we shall do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\n      after general assurances of his affection for her and all her\\r\\n      family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\\r\\n      and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\\r\\n      Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not give way to useless alarm,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthough it is right\\r\\n      to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it\\r\\n      as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a\\r\\n      few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know\\r\\n      that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not\\r\\n      let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I\\r\\n      shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to\\r\\n      Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what\\r\\n      is to be done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear brother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is exactly what\\r\\n      I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find\\r\\n      them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married\\r\\n      already, _make_ them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not\\r\\n      let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much\\r\\n      money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And,\\r\\n      above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a\\r\\n      dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\n      have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me\\xe2\\x80\\x94such spasms\\r\\n      in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that\\r\\n      I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not\\r\\n      to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\\r\\n      for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,\\r\\n      how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\\r\\n      endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation\\r\\n      to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with\\r\\n      her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left\\r\\n      her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in\\r\\n      the absence of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\\r\\n      real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\\r\\n      attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\\r\\n      enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited\\r\\n      at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household,\\r\\n      and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her\\r\\n      fears and solicitude on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who\\r\\n      had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make\\r\\n      their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other\\r\\n      from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably\\r\\n      calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss\\r\\n      of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself\\r\\n      incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than\\r\\n      usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress\\r\\n      enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of\\r\\n      grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\\r\\n      talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the\\r\\n      wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\\r\\n      added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from\\r\\n      it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\\r\\n      irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\\r\\n      that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and\\r\\n      that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\\r\\n      undeserving of the other sex.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\\r\\n      oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console\\r\\n      herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before\\r\\n      them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\r\\n      half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\\r\\n      herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane\\r\\n      was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general\\r\\n      lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\\r\\n      Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\\r\\n      not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\\r\\n      subject, by saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut tell me all and everything about it\\r\\n      which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What\\r\\n      did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything\\r\\n      before the elopement took place? They must have seen them\\r\\n      together for ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cColonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\\r\\n      partiality, especially on Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side, but nothing to give him\\r\\n      any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive\\r\\n      and kind to the utmost. He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure\\r\\n      us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone\\r\\n      to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\\r\\n      his journey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he\\r\\n      know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny\\r\\n      himself?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing\\r\\n      anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\\r\\n      about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\\r\\n      marrying\\xe2\\x80\\x94and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have\\r\\n      been misunderstood before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\\r\\n      entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I\\r\\n      felt a little uneasy\\xe2\\x80\\x94a little fearful of my sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happiness\\r\\n      with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not\\r\\n      been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of\\r\\n      that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then\\r\\n      owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest\\r\\n      of us, that in Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last letter she had prepared her for such\\r\\n      a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each\\r\\n      other, many weeks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut not before they went to Brighton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I believe not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?\\r\\n      Does he know his real character?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\\r\\n      formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\r\\n      And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he\\r\\n      left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of\\r\\n      him, this could not have happened!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it would have been better,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied her sister. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut to\\r\\n      expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their\\r\\n      present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the\\r\\n      best intentions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCould Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s note to\\r\\n      his wife?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe brought it with him for us to see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\r\\n      These were the contents:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Harriet,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\\r\\n      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I\\r\\n      am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess\\r\\n      with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man\\r\\n      in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy\\r\\n      without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send\\r\\n      them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it\\r\\n      will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign\\r\\n      my name \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lydia Wickham.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 What a good joke it will be! I can\\r\\n      hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not\\r\\n      keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I\\r\\n      hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will\\r\\n      dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I\\r\\n      shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you\\r\\n      would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown\\r\\n      before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel\\r\\n      Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour affectionate friend,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLYDIA BENNET.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth when she\\r\\n      had finished it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a letter is this, to be written at such a\\r\\n      moment! But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the\\r\\n      subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade\\r\\n      her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor\\r\\n      father! how he must have felt it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for\\r\\n      full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the\\r\\n      whole house in such confusion!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Jane,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas there a servant belonging to it\\r\\n      who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a\\r\\n      time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I\\r\\n      endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid\\r\\n      I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what\\r\\n      might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not\\r\\n      look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care\\r\\n      and anxiety upon yourself alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\\r\\n      every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either\\r\\n      of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\\r\\n      that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt\\r\\n      Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away;\\r\\n      and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of\\r\\n      great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very\\r\\n      kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us,\\r\\n      and offered her services, or any of her daughters\\xe2\\x80\\x99, if they\\r\\n      should be of use to us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe had better have stayed at home,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps\\r\\n      she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\\r\\n      cannot see too little of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neighbours. Assistance is\\r\\n      impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at\\r\\n      a distance, and be satisfied.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father\\r\\n      had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his\\r\\n      daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe meant I believe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto go to Epsom, the place\\r\\n      where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\\r\\n      anything could be made out from them. His principal object must\\r\\n      be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them\\r\\n      from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he\\r\\n      thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s removing\\r\\n      from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make\\r\\n      enquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house\\r\\n      the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make\\r\\n      enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out\\r\\n      the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other\\r\\n      designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be\\r\\n      gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had\\r\\n      difficulty in finding out even so much as this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 48\\r\\n\\r\\n      The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\\r\\n      next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\\r\\n      from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a\\r\\n      most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\\r\\n      they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he\\r\\n      had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of _that_ they\\r\\n      would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only\\r\\n      for the letters before he set off.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\\r\\n      constant information of what was going on, and their uncle\\r\\n      promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\\r\\n      Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\\r\\n      sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      not being killed in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a\\r\\n      few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\\r\\n      serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\\r\\n      freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\\r\\n      always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\\r\\n      them up\\xe2\\x80\\x94though, as she never came without reporting some fresh\\r\\n      instance of Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom\\r\\n      went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\\r\\n      them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\\r\\n      months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared\\r\\n      to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues,\\r\\n      all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into\\r\\n      every tradesman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family. Everybody declared that he was the\\r\\n      wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out\\r\\n      that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.\\r\\n      Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said,\\r\\n      believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruin\\r\\n      more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it,\\r\\n      became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come\\r\\n      when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\\r\\n      entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained\\r\\n      some news of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\\r\\n      received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he\\r\\n      had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come\\r\\n      to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and\\r\\n      Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory\\r\\n      information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the\\r\\n      principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they\\r\\n      might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London,\\r\\n      before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not\\r\\n      expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was\\r\\n      eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London\\r\\n      and promised to write again very soon. There was also a\\r\\n      postscript to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\r\\n      possible, from some of the young man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intimates in the regiment,\\r\\n      whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be\\r\\n      likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself.\\r\\n      If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability\\r\\n      of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential\\r\\n      consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel\\r\\n      Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy\\r\\n      us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could\\r\\n      tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other\\r\\n      person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference\\r\\n      to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give\\r\\n      any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment\\r\\n      deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations,\\r\\n      except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many\\r\\n      years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in\\r\\n      the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire might be able to give more information; and though\\r\\n      she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a\\r\\n      something to look forward to.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\\r\\n      anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival\\r\\n      of letters was the grand object of every morning\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impatience.\\r\\n      Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be\\r\\n      communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some\\r\\n      news of importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\\r\\n      for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\\r\\n      which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\\r\\n      him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew\\r\\n      what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and\\r\\n      read it likewise. It was as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Sir,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\\r\\n      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are\\r\\n      now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a\\r\\n      letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.\\r\\n      Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your\\r\\n      respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of\\r\\n      the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time\\r\\n      can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can\\r\\n      alleviate so severe a misfortune\\xe2\\x80\\x94or that may comfort you, under a\\r\\n      circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a\\r\\n      parent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a\\r\\n      blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be\\r\\n      lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\\r\\n      informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your\\r\\n      daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;\\r\\n      though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must\\r\\n      be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity,\\r\\n      at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to\\r\\n      be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins,\\r\\n      but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have\\r\\n      related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this\\r\\n      false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of\\r\\n      all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself\\r\\n      condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?\\r\\n      And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with\\r\\n      augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for\\r\\n      had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your\\r\\n      sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console\\r\\n      yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child\\r\\n      from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of\\r\\n      her own heinous offense.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am, dear sir, etc., etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\\r\\n      from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\\r\\n      nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single\\r\\n      relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was\\r\\n      certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances\\r\\n      had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did\\r\\n      not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any\\r\\n      of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as\\r\\n      likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his\\r\\n      own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in\\r\\n      addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relations, for it\\r\\n      had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a\\r\\n      very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than\\r\\n      a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at\\r\\n      Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour\\r\\n      were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to\\r\\n      conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard\\r\\n      them with horror. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA gamester!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is wholly\\r\\n      unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\\r\\n      their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\r\\n      Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours,\\r\\n      he had yielded to his brother-in-law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entreaty that he would\\r\\n      return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion\\r\\n      might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much\\r\\n      satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her\\r\\n      anxiety for his life had been before.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is\\r\\n      to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that\\r\\n      she and the children should go to London, at the same time that\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the\\r\\n      first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to\\r\\n      Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and\\r\\n      her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the\\r\\n      world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them\\r\\n      by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from\\r\\n      him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her\\r\\n      return that could come from Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse\\r\\n      for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore,\\r\\n      could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who\\r\\n      was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings,\\r\\n      was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she\\r\\n      could have borne the dread of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infamy somewhat better. It\\r\\n      would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of\\r\\n      two.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\r\\n      philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in\\r\\n      the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\\r\\n      taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\\r\\n      courage to speak of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\\r\\n      that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\\r\\n      her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured,\\r\\n      he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself?\\r\\n      It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must not be too severe upon yourself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so\\r\\n      prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how\\r\\n      much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered\\r\\n      by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you suppose them to be in London?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; where else can they be so well concealed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd Lydia used to want to go to London,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is happy then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her father drily; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand her residence\\r\\n      there will probably be of some duration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Then after a short silence he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice\\r\\n      to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some\\r\\n      greatness of mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\\r\\n      mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a parade,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich does one good; it gives such\\r\\n      an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will\\r\\n      sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as\\r\\n      much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty\\r\\n      runs away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not going to run away, papa,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kitty fretfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf _I_\\r\\n      should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as\\r\\n      Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\\r\\n      be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is\\r\\n      ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\\r\\n      village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\\r\\n      with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors\\r\\n      till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\\r\\n      in a rational manner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to\\r\\n      cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo not make yourself unhappy. If you are\\r\\n      a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\\r\\n      at the end of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 49\\r\\n\\r\\n      Two days after Mr. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\\r\\n      walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the\\r\\n      housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to\\r\\n      call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead\\r\\n      of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to\\r\\n      Miss Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but\\r\\n      I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I\\r\\n      took the liberty of coming to ask.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\n      know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He\\r\\n      has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\r\\n      They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\\r\\n      thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were\\r\\n      on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when\\r\\n      they were met by the butler, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you are looking for my master, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am, he is walking towards\\r\\n      the little copse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\\r\\n      once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\\r\\n      deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of\\r\\n      the paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as\\r\\n      Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\\r\\n      breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, papa, what news\\xe2\\x80\\x94what news? Have you heard from my uncle?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes I have had a letter from him by express.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, and what news does it bring\\xe2\\x80\\x94good or bad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is there of good to be expected?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, taking the\\r\\n      letter from his pocket. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps you would like to read it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRead it aloud,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said their father, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor I hardly know myself\\r\\n      what it is about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGracechurch Street, _Monday, August_ 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Brother,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\\r\\n      as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon\\r\\n      after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out\\r\\n      in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till\\r\\n      we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen\\r\\n      them both\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n          \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen it is as I always hoped,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Jane; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey are\\r\\n          married!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth read on:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find\\r\\n      there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\\r\\n      perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your\\r\\n      side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is\\r\\n      required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,\\r\\n      her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\\r\\n      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\r\\n      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\\r\\n      your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\r\\n      which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\\r\\n      with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall\\r\\n      send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me\\r\\n      your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\\r\\n      that Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are\\r\\n      generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that\\r\\n      respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money,\\r\\n      even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in\\r\\n      addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case,\\r\\n      you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole\\r\\n      of this business, I will immediately give directions to\\r\\n      Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be\\r\\n      the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore\\r\\n      stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.\\r\\n      Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write\\r\\n      explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be\\r\\n      married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She\\r\\n      comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more\\r\\n      is determined on. Yours, etc.,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEDW. GARDINER.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it possible?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan it\\r\\n      be possible that he will marry her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      her sister. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear father, I congratulate you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd have you answered the letter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; but it must be done soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time\\r\\n      before he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear father,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccome back and write\\r\\n      immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a\\r\\n      case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me write for you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you dislike the trouble\\r\\n      yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dislike it very much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it must be done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the\\r\\n      house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd may I ask\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the terms, I suppose, must\\r\\n      be complied with.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cComplied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But\\r\\n      there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how\\r\\n      much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the\\r\\n      other, how am I ever to pay him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoney! My uncle!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat do you mean, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight\\r\\n      a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty\\r\\n      after I am gone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is very true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthough it had not occurred\\r\\n      to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to\\r\\n      remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doings! Generous, good man, I\\r\\n      am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all\\r\\n      this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her father; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fool if he takes her with a\\r\\n      farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to\\r\\n      think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\\r\\n      repaid?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\\r\\n      continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then\\r\\n      went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\\r\\n      breakfast-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd they are really to be married!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, as soon as\\r\\n      they were by themselves. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we\\r\\n      are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their\\r\\n      chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are\\r\\n      forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI comfort myself with thinking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat he\\r\\n      certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for\\r\\n      her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\\r\\n      him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\\r\\n      it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have\\r\\n      more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he were ever able to learn what Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debts have been,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand how much is settled on his side on our\\r\\n      sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\\r\\n      them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness\\r\\n      of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her\\r\\n      home, and affording her their personal protection and\\r\\n      countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of\\r\\n      gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually\\r\\n      with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she\\r\\n      will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\\r\\n      first sees my aunt!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      said Jane: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope and trust they will yet be happy. His\\r\\n      consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is\\r\\n      come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will\\r\\n      steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,\\r\\n      and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past\\r\\n      imprudence forgotten.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTheir conduct has been such,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas neither\\r\\n      you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of\\r\\n      it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\\r\\n      likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to\\r\\n      the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would\\r\\n      not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and,\\r\\n      without raising his head, coolly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust as you please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay we take my uncle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter to read to her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake whatever you like, and get away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\\r\\n      up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\\r\\n      one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight\\r\\n      preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr.\\r\\n      Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hope of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being soon married, her joy burst\\r\\n      forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She\\r\\n      was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever\\r\\n      been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\\r\\n      would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\\r\\n      felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, dear Lydia!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is delightful indeed! She\\r\\n      will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at\\r\\n      sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he\\r\\n      would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear\\r\\n      Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write\\r\\n      to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run\\r\\n      down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay,\\r\\n      stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will\\r\\n      put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we\\r\\n      shall be together when we meet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\\r\\n      violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\\r\\n      obligations which Mr. Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behaviour laid them all under.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor we must attribute this happy conclusion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin a\\r\\n      great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has\\r\\n      pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is all very right; who should do it\\r\\n      but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and\\r\\n      my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\\r\\n      first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\\r\\n      presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a\\r\\n      daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was\\r\\n      only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter,\\r\\n      that I am sure I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t write; so I will dictate, and you write\\r\\n      for me. We will settle with your father about the money\\r\\n      afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,\\r\\n      and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful\\r\\n      orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her\\r\\n      to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother\\r\\n      was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,\\r\\n      too, came into her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will go to Meryton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas soon as I am dressed, and\\r\\n      tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come\\r\\n      back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and\\r\\n      order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I\\r\\n      am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here\\r\\n      comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss\\r\\n      Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of\\r\\n      punch to make merry at her wedding.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received\\r\\n      her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this\\r\\n      folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with\\r\\n      freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Poor Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it\\r\\n      was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and\\r\\n      though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\\r\\n      worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\\r\\n      looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\\r\\n      felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 50\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\\r\\n      that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\\r\\n      annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\\r\\n      wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had\\r\\n      he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\\r\\n      indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now\\r\\n      be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of\\r\\n      the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband\\r\\n      might then have rested in its proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\\r\\n      anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\\r\\n      brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\\r\\n      the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\\r\\n      soon as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\\r\\n      perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The\\r\\n      son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should\\r\\n      be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means\\r\\n      be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world,\\r\\n      but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years\\r\\n      after Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birth, had been certain that he would. This event\\r\\n      had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\\r\\n      saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\\r\\n      income.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be\\r\\n      divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\r\\n      This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now\\r\\n      to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\\r\\n      acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful\\r\\n      acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed\\r\\n      most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\r\\n      approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil\\r\\n      the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before\\r\\n      supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\\r\\n      daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\\r\\n      himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten\\r\\n      pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them;\\r\\n      for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual\\r\\n      presents in money which passed to her through her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands,\\r\\n      Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expenses had been very little within that sum.\\r\\n\\r\\n      That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\\r\\n      too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\\r\\n      was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When\\r\\n      the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\\r\\n      seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\\r\\n      indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\\r\\n      in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged\\r\\n      to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his\\r\\n      brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The good news spread quickly through the house, and with\\r\\n      proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in\\r\\n      the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been\\r\\n      more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come\\r\\n      upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded\\r\\n      from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to\\r\\n      be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her\\r\\n      well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old\\r\\n      ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this\\r\\n      change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery\\r\\n      was considered certain.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\\r\\n      this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\\r\\n      and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a\\r\\n      damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been\\r\\n      the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on\\r\\n      the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran\\r\\n      wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new\\r\\n      carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the\\r\\n      neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and,\\r\\n      without knowing or considering what their income might be,\\r\\n      rejected many as deficient in size and importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHaye Park might do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif the Gouldings could quit\\r\\n      it\\xe2\\x80\\x94or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;\\r\\n      but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten\\r\\n      miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\\r\\n      servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her:\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your\\r\\n      son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into\\r\\n      _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\\r\\n      admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by\\r\\n      receiving them at Longbourn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\\r\\n      firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\\r\\n      amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea\\r\\n      to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should\\r\\n      receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be\\r\\n      carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse\\r\\n      his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would\\r\\n      scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She\\r\\n      was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must\\r\\n      reflect on her daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at\\r\\n      her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took\\r\\n      place.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\\r\\n      distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\\r\\n      with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so\\r\\n      shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might\\r\\n      hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who\\r\\n      were not immediately on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There\\r\\n      were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently\\r\\n      depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge\\r\\n      of a sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s frailty would have mortified her so much\\xe2\\x80\\x94not,\\r\\n      however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to\\r\\n      herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between\\r\\n      them. Had Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marriage been concluded on the most honourable\\r\\n      terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect\\r\\n      himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now\\r\\n      be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a\\r\\n      man whom he so justly scorned.\\r\\n\\r\\n      From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.\\r\\n      The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself\\r\\n      of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation\\r\\n      survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved;\\r\\n      she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous\\r\\n      of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by\\r\\n      it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance\\r\\n      of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have\\r\\n      been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should\\r\\n      meet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that\\r\\n      the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago,\\r\\n      would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was\\r\\n      as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex;\\r\\n      but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\\r\\n      disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding\\r\\n      and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her\\r\\n      wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of\\r\\n      both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been\\r\\n      softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement,\\r\\n      information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received\\r\\n      benefit of greater importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude\\r\\n      what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different\\r\\n      tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon\\r\\n      to be formed in their family.\\r\\n\\r\\n      How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\\r\\n      independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent\\r\\n      happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together\\r\\n      because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could\\r\\n      easily conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\\r\\n      eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\\r\\n      concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\\r\\n      mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was\\r\\n      to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\\r\\n      militia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was greatly my wish that he should do so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas soon\\r\\n      as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me,\\r\\n      in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,\\r\\n      both on his account and my niece\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. It is Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intention\\r\\n      to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are\\r\\n      still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He\\r\\n      has the promise of an ensigncy in General \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regiment, now\\r\\n      quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from\\r\\n      this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among\\r\\n      different people, where they may each have a character to\\r\\n      preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to\\r\\n      Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and\\r\\n      to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment,\\r\\n      for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the\\r\\n      trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in\\r\\n      Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his\\r\\n      information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he\\r\\n      has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will\\r\\n      be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless\\r\\n      they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before\\r\\n      she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully\\r\\n      remembered to you and her mother.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Yours, etc.,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cE. GARDINER.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      removal from the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being\\r\\n      settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure\\r\\n      and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her\\r\\n      plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe\\r\\n      disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia\\r\\n      should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with\\r\\n      everybody, and had so many favourites.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit will be quite\\r\\n      shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young\\r\\n      men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so\\r\\n      pleasant in General \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regiment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      His daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\r\\n      admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\r\\n      received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,\\r\\n      who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings\\r\\n      and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by\\r\\n      her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so\\r\\n      mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as\\r\\n      they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they\\r\\n      thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the\\r\\n      satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her\\r\\n      married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to\\r\\n      the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,\\r\\n      he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that\\r\\n      as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to\\r\\n      Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should\\r\\n      consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own\\r\\n      inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object\\r\\n      of her wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 51\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\\r\\n      for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was\\r\\n      sent to meet them at \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94, and they were to return in it by\\r\\n      dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets,\\r\\n      and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would\\r\\n      have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, and was\\r\\n      wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\\r\\n      receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\\r\\n      carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\\r\\n      grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\\r\\n      open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards,\\r\\n      embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with\\r\\n      an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and\\r\\n      wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of\\r\\n      their happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was\\r\\n      not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;\\r\\n      and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young\\r\\n      couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was\\r\\n      disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia\\r\\n      still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\\r\\n      from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when\\r\\n      at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took\\r\\n      notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a\\r\\n      laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\\r\\n      manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\\r\\n      marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\\r\\n      address, while he claimed their relationship, would have\\r\\n      delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite\\r\\n      equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within\\r\\n      herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an\\r\\n      impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of\\r\\n      the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\\r\\n      colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n      There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could\\r\\n      neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\\r\\n      sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in\\r\\n      that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very\\r\\n      unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have\\r\\n      the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was\\r\\n      recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects\\r\\n      which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly think of its being three months,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csince I went\\r\\n      away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been\\r\\n      things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went\\r\\n      away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came\\r\\n      back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth\\r\\n      looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\\r\\n      anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I\\r\\n      was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in\\r\\n      his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let\\r\\n      down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let\\r\\n      my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the\\r\\n      ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the\\r\\n      room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through\\r\\n      the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough\\r\\n      to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right\\r\\n      hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! Jane, I take\\r\\n      your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married\\r\\n      woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\\r\\n      embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\r\\n      Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\\r\\n      hear herself called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by each of them; and in the\\r\\n      mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of\\r\\n      being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, mamma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, when they were all returned to the\\r\\n      breakfast room, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\\r\\n      charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope\\r\\n      they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton.\\r\\n      That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we\\r\\n      did not all go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I\\r\\n      don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, lord! yes;\\xe2\\x80\\x94there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\\r\\n      things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.\\r\\n      We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there\\r\\n      will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for\\r\\n      them all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should like it beyond anything!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\\r\\n      sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them\\r\\n      before the winter is over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thank you for my share of the favour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I\\r\\n      do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he\\r\\n      was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\\r\\n      short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\\r\\n      her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These\\r\\n      parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even\\r\\n      more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\\r\\n      expected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for him. She had\\r\\n      scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the\\r\\n      reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the\\r\\n      strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have\\r\\n      wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope\\r\\n      with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was\\r\\n      rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were\\r\\n      the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of\\r\\n      having a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on\\r\\n      every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He\\r\\n      did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill\\r\\n      more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the\\r\\n      country.\\r\\n\\r\\n      One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\\r\\n      her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.\\r\\n      You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\r\\n      Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo really,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think there cannot be too\\r\\n      little said on the subject.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We\\r\\n      were married, you know, at St. Clement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, because Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should\\r\\n      all be there by eleven o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to\\r\\n      go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,\\r\\n      Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\\r\\n      you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I\\r\\n      should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the\\r\\n      time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she\\r\\n      was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\\r\\n      ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I\\r\\n      longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would\\r\\n      never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my\\r\\n      uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with\\r\\n      them. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of\\r\\n      doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme,\\r\\n      or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the\\r\\n      Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came\\r\\n      to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that\\r\\n      horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get\\r\\n      together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did\\r\\n      not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\\r\\n      were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,\\r\\n      luckily, he came back again in ten minutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 time, and then we all\\r\\n      set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been\\r\\n      prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      might have done as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x94he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But\\r\\n      gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word\\r\\n      about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?\\r\\n      It was to be such a secret!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it was to be secret,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csay not another word on the\\r\\n      subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe will ask you no questions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lydia, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor if you did, I should certainly tell\\r\\n      you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out\\r\\n      of her power, by running away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\\r\\n      least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had\\r\\n      been at her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly\\r\\n      among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least\\r\\n      temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and\\r\\n      wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.\\r\\n      Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the\\r\\n      noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such\\r\\n      suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short\\r\\n      letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had\\r\\n      dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\\r\\n      intended.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may readily comprehend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat my curiosity must\\r\\n      be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\\r\\n      (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\\r\\n      been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me\\r\\n      understand it\\xe2\\x80\\x94unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in\\r\\n      the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must\\r\\n      endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot that I _shall_, though,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added to herself, as she\\r\\n      finished the letter; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in\\r\\n      an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and\\r\\n      stratagems to find it out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\r\\n      Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\\r\\n      glad of it;\\xe2\\x80\\x94till it appeared whether her enquiries would receive\\r\\n      any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 52\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\\r\\n      letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in\\r\\n      possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she\\r\\n      was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the\\r\\n      benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter\\r\\n      convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGracechurch Street, _Sept_. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Niece,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\r\\n      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing\\r\\n      will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\\r\\n      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\\r\\n      Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know\\r\\n      that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_\\r\\n      side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\\r\\n      impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am\\xe2\\x80\\x94and nothing\\r\\n      but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\\r\\n      him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\\r\\n      ignorant, I must be more explicit.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had\\r\\n      a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with\\r\\n      him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my\\r\\n      curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have\\r\\n      been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where\\r\\n      your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked\\r\\n      with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can\\r\\n      collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and\\r\\n      came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive\\r\\n      professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that\\r\\n      Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it\\r\\n      impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in\\r\\n      him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\\r\\n      confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his\\r\\n      private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for\\r\\n      itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and\\r\\n      endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.\\r\\n      If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace\\r\\n      him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to\\r\\n      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which\\r\\n      was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\\r\\n      reason for his resolving to follow us.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\\r\\n      governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on\\r\\n      some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She\\r\\n      then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since\\r\\n      maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he\\r\\n      knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for\\r\\n      intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or\\r\\n      three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would\\r\\n      not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption,\\r\\n      for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham\\r\\n      indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\\r\\n      she been able to receive them into her house, they would have\\r\\n      taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind\\r\\n      friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94 street.\\r\\n      He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His\\r\\n      first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her\\r\\n      to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\\r\\n      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\\r\\n      offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found\\r\\n      Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\\r\\n      for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not\\r\\n      hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some\\r\\n      time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were\\r\\n      her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and\\r\\n      expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with\\r\\n      Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He\\r\\n      confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of\\r\\n      some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not\\r\\n      to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flight on her own\\r\\n      folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and\\r\\n      as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about\\r\\n      it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew\\r\\n      he should have nothing to live on.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.\\r\\n      Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\\r\\n      been able to do something for him, and his situation must have\\r\\n      been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this\\r\\n      question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more\\r\\n      effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.\\r\\n      Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof\\r\\n      against the temptation of immediate relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\r\\n      Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\\r\\n      was reduced to be reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next step\\r\\n      was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in\\r\\n      Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr.\\r\\n      Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further\\r\\n      enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town\\r\\n      the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person\\r\\n      whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore\\r\\n      readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the\\r\\n      former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was\\r\\n      only known that a gentleman had called on business.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at\\r\\n      home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\\r\\n      together.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not\\r\\n      all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was\\r\\n      sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\\r\\n      fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\r\\n      after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times,\\r\\n      but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did\\r\\n      not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be\\r\\n      thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most\\r\\n      readily have settled the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey battled it together for a long time, which was more than\\r\\n      either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at\\r\\n      last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed\\r\\n      to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having\\r\\n      the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain;\\r\\n      and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great\\r\\n      pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him\\r\\n      of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\r\\n      But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at\\r\\n      most.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the\\r\\n      young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to\\r\\n      considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in\\r\\n      addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission\\r\\n      purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone,\\r\\n      was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\\r\\n      reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had\\r\\n      been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\\r\\n      in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s_\\r\\n      reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all\\r\\n      this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured\\r\\n      that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him\\r\\n      credit for _another interest_ in the affair.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends,\\r\\n      who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he\\r\\n      should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and\\r\\n      all money matters were then to receive the last finish.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation\\r\\n      which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least\\r\\n      it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and\\r\\n      Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was exactly\\r\\n      what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would\\r\\n      not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\\r\\n      while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter\\r\\n      last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\\r\\n      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\\r\\n      fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious\\r\\n      manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\\r\\n      done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If\\r\\n      she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not\\r\\n      listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my\\r\\n      dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with\\r\\n      her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\\r\\n      attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to\\r\\n      leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry\\r\\n      with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying\\r\\n      (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.\\r\\n      His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as\\r\\n      when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all\\r\\n      please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and\\r\\n      _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him. I\\r\\n      thought him very sly;\\xe2\\x80\\x94he hardly ever mentioned your name. But\\r\\n      slyness seems the fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do\\r\\n      not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be\\r\\n      quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton,\\r\\n      with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this\\r\\n      half hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYours, very sincerely,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cM. GARDINER.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of\\r\\n      spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure\\r\\n      or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled\\r\\n      suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might\\r\\n      have been doing to forward her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s match, which she had\\r\\n      feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be\\r\\n      probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain\\r\\n      of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be\\r\\n      true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on\\r\\n      himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\\r\\n      research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman\\r\\n      whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to\\r\\n      meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe,\\r\\n      the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name\\r\\n      it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a\\r\\n      girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did\\r\\n      whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\\r\\n      checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her\\r\\n      vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection\\r\\n      for her\\xe2\\x80\\x94for a woman who had already refused him\\xe2\\x80\\x94as able to\\r\\n      overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against\\r\\n      relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind\\r\\n      of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure,\\r\\n      done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a\\r\\n      reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch\\r\\n      of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\\r\\n      wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it;\\r\\n      and though she would not place herself as his principal\\r\\n      inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality\\r\\n      for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of\\r\\n      mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly\\r\\n      painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who\\r\\n      could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia,\\r\\n      her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she\\r\\n      grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,\\r\\n      every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself\\r\\n      she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause\\r\\n      of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of\\r\\n      himself. She read over her aunt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commendation of him again and\\r\\n      again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even\\r\\n      sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding\\r\\n      how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that\\r\\n      affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was\\r\\n      overtaken by Wickham.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      said he, as he joined her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou certainly do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied with a smile; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it does not\\r\\n      follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should be sorry indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good\\r\\n      friends; and now we are better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue. Are the others coming out?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage\\r\\n      to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and\\r\\n      aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She replied in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be\\r\\n      too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.\\r\\n      And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she\\r\\n      was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my\\r\\n      name to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, she did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what did she say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\\xe2\\x80\\x94not\\r\\n      turned out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things\\r\\n      are strangely misrepresented.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\\r\\n      silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each\\r\\n      other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must be something particular, to take him there at\\r\\n      this time of year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I\\r\\n      thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; he introduced us to his sister.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd do you like her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\\r\\n      this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very\\r\\n      promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out\\r\\n      well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you go by the village of Kympton?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not recollect that we did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\\r\\n      had. A most delightful place!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Excellent Parsonage House! It would\\r\\n      have suited me in every respect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow should you have liked making sermons?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my\\r\\n      duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought\\r\\n      not to repine;\\xe2\\x80\\x94but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing\\r\\n      for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have\\r\\n      answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you\\r\\n      ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that\\r\\n      it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\\r\\n      present patron.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from\\r\\n      the first, you may remember.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was\\r\\n      not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you\\r\\n      actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and\\r\\n      that the business had been compromised accordingly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may\\r\\n      remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of\\r\\n      it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked\\r\\n      fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, to\\r\\n      provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not\\r\\n      let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be\\r\\n      always of one mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry,\\r\\n      though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 53\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation\\r\\n      that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear\\r\\n      sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was\\r\\n      pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The day of his and Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no\\r\\n      means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle,\\r\\n      was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear Lydia,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen shall we meet again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, lord! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWrite to me very often, my dear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs often as I can. But you know married women have never much\\r\\n      time for writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have\\r\\n      nothing else to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n      He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is as fine a fellow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were\\r\\n      out of the house, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and\\r\\n      makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even\\r\\n      Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several\\r\\n      days.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI often think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat there is nothing so bad as\\r\\n      parting with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a\\r\\n      daughter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must make you better satisfied\\r\\n      that your other four are single.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is\\r\\n      married, but only because her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regiment happens to be so\\r\\n      far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so\\r\\n      soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was\\r\\n      shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of\\r\\n      hope, by an article of news which then began to be in\\r\\n      circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders\\r\\n      to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in\\r\\n      a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was\\r\\n      quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook\\r\\n      her head by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (for\\r\\n      Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, so much the\\r\\n      better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us,\\r\\n      you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But,\\r\\n      however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes\\r\\n      it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us.\\r\\n      You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word\\r\\n      about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may depend on it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied the other, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor Mrs. Nicholls was\\r\\n      in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself\\r\\n      on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was\\r\\n      certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very\\r\\n      likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, she told me,\\r\\n      on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got\\r\\n      three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without\\r\\n      changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his\\r\\n      name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together,\\r\\n      she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the\\r\\n      present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\n      imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the\\r\\n      moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure\\r\\n      you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or\\r\\n      pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we\\r\\n      shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but\\r\\n      I dread other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him\\r\\n      in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming\\r\\n      there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she\\r\\n      still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the\\r\\n      greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      permission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYet it is hard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she sometimes thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat this poor man\\r\\n      cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without\\r\\n      raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be\\r\\n      her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could\\r\\n      easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were\\r\\n      more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\\r\\n      parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou will wait on him of course.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised,\\r\\n      if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it\\r\\n      ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s errand\\r\\n      again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an\\r\\n      attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his\\r\\n      returning to Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he wants our\\r\\n      society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not\\r\\n      spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they\\r\\n      go away and come back again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do\\r\\n      not wait on him. But, however, that shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prevent my asking him\\r\\n      to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the\\r\\n      Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there\\r\\n      will be just room at table for him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\\r\\n      husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that\\r\\n      her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it,\\r\\n      before _they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane to her\\r\\n      sister. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\\r\\n      indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\\r\\n      talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one\\r\\n      can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be,\\r\\n      when his stay at Netherfield is over!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish I could say anything to comfort you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth;\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the\\r\\n      usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied\\r\\n      me, because you have always so much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of\\r\\n      servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the\\r\\n      period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as\\r\\n      it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their\\r\\n      invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on\\r\\n      the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw\\r\\n      him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride\\r\\n      towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane\\r\\n      resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy\\r\\n      her mother, went to the window\\xe2\\x80\\x94she looked,\\xe2\\x80\\x94she saw Mr. Darcy with\\r\\n      him, and sat down again by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a gentleman with him, mamma,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kitty; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho can it\\r\\n      be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do\\r\\n      not know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Kitty, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit looks just like that man that used to be\\r\\n      with him before. Mr. what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so it does, I vow. Well, any\\r\\n      friend of Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will always be welcome here, to be sure;\\r\\n      but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but\\r\\n      little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the\\r\\n      awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost\\r\\n      for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both\\r\\n      sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and\\r\\n      of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her\\r\\n      dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only\\r\\n      as Mr. Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend, without being heard by either of them.\\r\\n      But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\\r\\n      suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment\\r\\n      towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she\\r\\n      had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own\\r\\n      more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole\\r\\n      family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she\\r\\n      regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at\\r\\n      least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her\\r\\n      astonishment at his coming\\xe2\\x80\\x94at his coming to Netherfield, to\\r\\n      Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to\\r\\n      what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in\\r\\n      Derbyshire.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half\\r\\n      a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added\\r\\n      lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that\\r\\n      his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would\\r\\n      not be secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me first see how he behaves,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit will then be\\r\\n      early enough for expectation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without\\r\\n      daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them\\r\\n      to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the\\r\\n      door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than\\r\\n      Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearing, her colour\\r\\n      increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a\\r\\n      propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of\\r\\n      resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and\\r\\n      sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\\r\\n      often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He\\r\\n      looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been\\r\\n      used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at\\r\\n      Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence be\\r\\n      what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not\\r\\n      an improbable, conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short\\r\\n      period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was\\r\\n      received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her\\r\\n      two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold\\r\\n      and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his\\r\\n      friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the\\r\\n      latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\\r\\n      irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\\r\\n      degree by a distinction so ill applied.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a\\r\\n      question which she could not answer without confusion, said\\r\\n      scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the\\r\\n      reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.\\r\\n      There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.\\r\\n      But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his\\r\\n      voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of\\r\\n      curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found\\r\\n      him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object\\r\\n      but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please,\\r\\n      than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was\\r\\n      disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCould I expect it to be otherwise!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYet why did he\\r\\n      come?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;\\r\\n      and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He readily agreed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI began to be afraid you would never come back again. People\\r\\n      _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;\\r\\n      but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have\\r\\n      happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is\\r\\n      married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you\\r\\n      have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It\\r\\n      was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put\\r\\n      in as it ought to be. It was only said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Lately, George Wickham,\\r\\n      Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 without there being a syllable said\\r\\n      of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was\\r\\n      my brother Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\\r\\n      make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\r\\n      Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,\\r\\n      therefore, she could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well\\r\\n      married,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued her mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut at the same time, Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.\\r\\n      They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it\\r\\n      seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His\\r\\n      regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving\\r\\n      the \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank\\r\\n      Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he\\r\\n      deserves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\\r\\n      misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew\\r\\n      from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else\\r\\n      had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he\\r\\n      meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he\\r\\n      believed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her\\r\\n      mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you\\r\\n      please on Mr. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy\\r\\n      to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\\r\\n      attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had\\r\\n      flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would\\r\\n      be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant,\\r\\n      she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself\\r\\n      amends for moments of such painful confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe first wish of my heart,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis never more\\r\\n      to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no\\r\\n      pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me\\r\\n      never see either one or the other again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\r\\n      compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from\\r\\n      observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the\\r\\n      admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had\\r\\n      spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be\\r\\n      giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she\\r\\n      had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though\\r\\n      not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should\\r\\n      be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she\\r\\n      talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that\\r\\n      she did not always know when she was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\\r\\n      her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine\\r\\n      at Longbourn in a few days time.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor\\r\\n      when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family\\r\\n      dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you\\r\\n      see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did\\r\\n      not come back and keep your engagement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\\r\\n      something of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\r\\n      They then went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and\\r\\n      dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good\\r\\n      table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be\\r\\n      good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or\\r\\n      satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a\\r\\n      year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 54\\r\\n\\r\\n      As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her\\r\\n      spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on\\r\\n      those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behaviour\\r\\n      astonished and vexed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid he come at all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,\\r\\n      when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come\\r\\n      hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing,\\r\\n      teasing, man! I will think no more about him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the\\r\\n      approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look,\\r\\n      which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat this first meeting is over, I feel\\r\\n      perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be\\r\\n      embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on\\r\\n      Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we\\r\\n      meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very indifferent indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, laughingly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh,\\r\\n      Jane, take care.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\\r\\n      now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think you are in very great danger of making him as much in\\r\\n      love with you as ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy\\r\\n      schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley,\\r\\n      in half an hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit, had revived.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and\\r\\n      the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their\\r\\n      punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they\\r\\n      repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see\\r\\n      whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former\\r\\n      parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother,\\r\\n      occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by\\r\\n      herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane\\r\\n      happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He\\r\\n      placed himself by her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\\r\\n      friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\\r\\n      imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had\\r\\n      she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an\\r\\n      expression of half-laughing alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n      His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\\r\\n      showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\\r\\n      formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\\r\\n      Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though\\r\\n      she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received\\r\\n      pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the\\r\\n      animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no\\r\\n      cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the\\r\\n      table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She\\r\\n      knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either,\\r\\n      or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to\\r\\n      hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they\\r\\n      spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner\\r\\n      whenever they did. Her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ungraciousness, made the sense of\\r\\n      what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind; and she\\r\\n      would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him\\r\\n      that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\\r\\n      the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\\r\\n      of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not\\r\\n      pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of\\r\\n      conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his\\r\\n      entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the\\r\\n      drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull\\r\\n      to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to\\r\\n      their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure\\r\\n      for the evening must depend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he does not come to me, _then_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall give him\\r\\n      up for ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\\r\\n      answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the\\r\\n      table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring\\r\\n      out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a\\r\\n      single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the\\r\\n      gentlemen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her\\r\\n      than ever, and said, in a whisper:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe men shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come and part us, I am determined. We want none\\r\\n      of them; do we?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed\\r\\n      him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely\\r\\n      patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged\\r\\n      against herself for being so silly!\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish\\r\\n      enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the\\r\\n      sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\\r\\n      proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to\\r\\n      their feelings!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\\r\\n      coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs your sister at Pemberley still?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, she will remain there till Christmas.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to\\r\\n      Scarborough, these three weeks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\\r\\n      converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her,\\r\\n      however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young\\r\\n      lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the\\r\\n      ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined\\r\\n      by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a\\r\\n      victim to her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rapacity for whist players, and in a few\\r\\n      moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost\\r\\n      every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening\\r\\n      at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his\\r\\n      eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to\\r\\n      make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\\r\\n      supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of\\r\\n      the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell girls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off\\r\\n      uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as\\r\\n      any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn\\xe2\\x80\\x94and everybody\\r\\n      said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times\\r\\n      better than what we had at the Lucases\\xe2\\x80\\x99 last week; and even Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well\\r\\n      done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.\\r\\n      And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs.\\r\\n      Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what\\r\\n      do you think she said besides? \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have\\r\\n      her at Netherfield at last.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long\\r\\n      is as good a creature as ever lived\\xe2\\x80\\x94and her nieces are very\\r\\n      pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them\\r\\n      prodigiously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\\r\\n      enough of Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\\r\\n      would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\\r\\n      family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\\r\\n      she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next\\r\\n      day, to make his proposals.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has been a very agreeable day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bennet to\\r\\n      Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe party seemed so well selected, so suitable one\\r\\n      with the other. I hope we may often meet again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies\\r\\n      me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation\\r\\n      as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish\\r\\n      beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now\\r\\n      are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is\\r\\n      only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a\\r\\n      stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very cruel,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her sister, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou will not let me\\r\\n      smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow hard it is in some cases to be believed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd how impossible in others!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\r\\n      acknowledge?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all\\r\\n      love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\\r\\n      knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not\\r\\n      make _me_ your confidante.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 55\\r\\n\\r\\n      A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.\\r\\n      His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to\\r\\n      return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and\\r\\n      was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine\\r\\n      with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed\\r\\n      himself engaged elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNext time you call,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope we shall be more lucky.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if\\r\\n      she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of\\r\\n      waiting on them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you come to-morrow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her\\r\\n      invitation was accepted with alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of\\r\\n      them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s room, in her\\r\\n      dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mr. Bingley\\r\\n      is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come\\r\\n      to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never\\r\\n      mind Miss Lizzy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will be down as soon as we can,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I dare say\\r\\n      Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half\\r\\n      an hour ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be\\r\\n      quick! Where is your sash, my dear?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\\r\\n      go down without one of her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in\\r\\n      the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was\\r\\n      his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two\\r\\n      obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking\\r\\n      and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time,\\r\\n      without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not\\r\\n      observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently\\r\\n      said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me\\r\\n      for? What am I to do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She then sat\\r\\n      still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious\\r\\n      occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome here,\\r\\n      my love, I want to speak to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d took her out of the room. Jane\\r\\n      instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at\\r\\n      such premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in\\r\\n      to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and\\r\\n      called out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was forced to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe may as well leave them by themselves you know;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her\\r\\n      mother, as soon as she was in the hall. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKitty and I are going up\\r\\n      stairs to sit in my dressing-room.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\\r\\n      quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then\\r\\n      returned into the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\\r\\n      every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her\\r\\n      daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\\r\\n      addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\\r\\n      officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with\\r\\n      a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to\\r\\n      the daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he\\r\\n      went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with\\r\\n      her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word\\r\\n      passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went\\r\\n      to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded,\\r\\n      unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,\\r\\n      however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have\\r\\n      taken place with that gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\\r\\n      spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was\\r\\n      much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was\\r\\n      nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his\\r\\n      ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more\\r\\n      communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen\\r\\n      him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the\\r\\n      evening Mrs. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invention was again at work to get every\\r\\n      body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\\r\\n      to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon\\r\\n      after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards,\\r\\n      she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s schemes.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was\\r\\n      finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to\\r\\n      fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening\\r\\n      the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together\\r\\n      over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had\\r\\n      this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily\\r\\n      turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it\\r\\n      all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought\\r\\n      was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\\r\\n      Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who\\r\\n      as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering\\r\\n      a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence\\r\\n      would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,\\r\\n      with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in\\r\\n      the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Tis too much!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby far too much. I do not deserve\\r\\n      it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\\r\\n      warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every\\r\\n      sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But\\r\\n      she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half\\r\\n      that remained to be said for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must go instantly to my mother;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would not on\\r\\n      any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her\\r\\n      to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father\\r\\n      already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give\\r\\n      such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much\\r\\n      happiness!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up\\r\\n      the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity\\r\\n      and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given\\r\\n      them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis the end of all his friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anxious\\r\\n      circumspection! of all his sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s falsehood and contrivance!\\r\\n      the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with\\r\\n      her father had been short and to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is your sister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare\\r\\n      say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\\r\\n      wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily\\r\\n      expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They\\r\\n      shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came\\r\\n      down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own\\r\\n      happiness, and of Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfections; and in spite of his being a\\r\\n      lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity\\r\\n      to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the\\r\\n      excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane,\\r\\n      and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\\r\\n      himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the\\r\\n      satisfaction of Miss Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind gave a glow of such sweet\\r\\n      animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\r\\n      Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation\\r\\n      in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked\\r\\n      to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet\\r\\n      joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how\\r\\n      really happy he was.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till\\r\\n      their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was\\r\\n      gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\r\\n      goodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are a good girl;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I have great pleasure in\\r\\n      thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of\\r\\n      your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means\\r\\n      unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever\\r\\n      be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and\\r\\n      so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\\r\\n      would be unpardonable in _me_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried his wife, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\r\\n      are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and\\r\\n      very likely more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then addressing her daughter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear,\\r\\n      dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a wink of sleep\\r\\n      all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so,\\r\\n      at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I\\r\\n      remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into\\r\\n      Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you\\r\\n      should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\\r\\n      ever was seen!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition\\r\\n      her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her\\r\\n      younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects\\r\\n      of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and\\r\\n      Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\\r\\n      Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\\r\\n      remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\\r\\n      neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an\\r\\n      invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\\r\\n      sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow\\r\\n      on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both\\r\\n      of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.\\r\\n      In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth,\\r\\n      for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone,\\r\\n      Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has made me so happy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, one evening, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby telling me\\r\\n      that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I\\r\\n      had not believed it possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suspected as much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut how did he account\\r\\n      for it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must have been his sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing. They were certainly no\\r\\n      friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,\\r\\n      since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many\\r\\n      respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their\\r\\n      brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we\\r\\n      shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once\\r\\n      were to each other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is the most unforgiving speech,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I\\r\\n      ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see\\r\\n      you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretended regard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last\\r\\n      November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of\\r\\n      _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down\\r\\n      again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of\\r\\n      his modesty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\\r\\n      diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\\r\\n      qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed\\r\\n      the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most\\r\\n      generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a\\r\\n      circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      cried Jane. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and\\r\\n      blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there\\r\\n      were but such another man for you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy\\r\\n      as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can\\r\\n      have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and,\\r\\n      perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.\\r\\n      Collins in time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be\\r\\n      long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the\\r\\n      same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in\\r\\n      the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first\\r\\n      run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for\\r\\n      misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 56\\r\\n\\r\\n      One morning, about a week after Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engagement with Jane\\r\\n      had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting\\r\\n      together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn\\r\\n      to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a\\r\\n      chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the\\r\\n      morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to\\r\\n      that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and\\r\\n      neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded\\r\\n      it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\\r\\n      somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet\\r\\n      to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with\\r\\n      him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of\\r\\n      the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,\\r\\n      till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was\\r\\n      Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\r\\n      astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them,\\r\\n      even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\\r\\n      made no other reply to Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s salutation than a slight\\r\\n      inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\r\\n      Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of\\r\\n      such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.\\r\\n      After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to\\r\\n      Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\\r\\n      mother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady\\r\\n      Catherine. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all\\r\\n      is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,\\r\\n      walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part\\r\\n      of the family.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have a very small park here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d returned Lady Catherine after\\r\\n      a short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but\\r\\n      I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\\r\\n      in summer; the windows are full west.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\\r\\n      and then added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left\\r\\n      Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her\\r\\n      from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her\\r\\n      calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\\r\\n      some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\\r\\n      very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,\\r\\n      said to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\\r\\n      wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a\\r\\n      turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand show her ladyship about the\\r\\n      different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\\r\\n      attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\\r\\n      hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\\r\\n      drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\\r\\n      decent looking rooms, walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\r\\n      waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the\\r\\n      gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\\r\\n      make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\\r\\n      than usually insolent and disagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow could I ever think her like her nephew?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, as she\\r\\n      looked in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\\r\\n      following manner:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of\\r\\n      my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell\\r\\n      you why I come.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to\\r\\n      account for the honour of seeing you here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou ought\\r\\n      to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere\\r\\n      _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character\\r\\n      has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in\\r\\n      a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from\\r\\n      it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I\\r\\n      was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most\\r\\n      advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet,\\r\\n      would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew,\\r\\n      my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous\\r\\n      falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\\r\\n      the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for\\r\\n      this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you believed it impossible to be true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth,\\r\\n      colouring with astonishment and disdain, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder you took the\\r\\n      trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by\\r\\n      it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt once to insist upon having such a report universally\\r\\n      contradicted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\n      Elizabeth coolly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill be rather a confirmation of it; if,\\r\\n      indeed, such a report is in existence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\\r\\n      industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such\\r\\n      a report is spread abroad?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never heard that it was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for\\r\\n      it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.\\r\\n      _You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being\\r\\n      satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\\r\\n      his reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of\\r\\n      infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to\\r\\n      all his family. You may have drawn him in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to\\r\\n      such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in\\r\\n      the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you are not entitled to know _mine;_ nor will such behaviour\\r\\n      as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\\r\\n      presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\\r\\n      he will make an offer to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their\\r\\n      infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the\\r\\n      favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in\\r\\n      their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when\\r\\n      the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\\r\\n      marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of\\r\\n      no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do\\r\\n      you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit\\r\\n      engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\\r\\n      propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his\\r\\n      earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there\\r\\n      is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\\r\\n      certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt\\r\\n      wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you\\r\\n      could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on\\r\\n      others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\\r\\n      confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And\\r\\n      if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\r\\n      Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by\\r\\n      his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\\r\\n      inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and\\r\\n      despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a\\r\\n      disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are heavy misfortunes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the wife\\r\\n      of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness\\r\\n      necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the\\r\\n      whole, have no cause to repine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cObstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your\\r\\n      gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to\\r\\n      me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss\\r\\n      Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of\\r\\n      carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not\\r\\n      been used to submit to any person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whims. I have not been in the\\r\\n      habit of brooking disappointment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_That_ will make your ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation at present more\\r\\n      pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and\\r\\n      my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the\\r\\n      maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s,\\r\\n      from respectable, honourable, and ancient\\xe2\\x80\\x94though\\r\\n      untitled\\xe2\\x80\\x94families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They\\r\\n      are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their\\r\\n      respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart\\r\\n      pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or\\r\\n      fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If\\r\\n      you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit\\r\\n      the sphere in which you have been brought up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\\r\\n      quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      daughter; so far we are equal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue. You _are_ a gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter. But who was your mother?\\r\\n      Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of\\r\\n      their condition.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever my connections may be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif your nephew\\r\\n      does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\\r\\n      Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say,\\r\\n      after a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deliberation:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine seemed pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd will you promise me, never to enter into such an\\r\\n      engagement?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will make no promise of the kind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a\\r\\n      more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a\\r\\n      belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have\\r\\n      given me the assurance I require.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be\\r\\n      intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship\\r\\n      wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you\\r\\n      the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more\\r\\n      probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing\\r\\n      to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\\r\\n      Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which\\r\\n      you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\\r\\n      frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely\\r\\n      mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such\\r\\n      persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your\\r\\n      interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have\\r\\n      certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,\\r\\n      therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\\r\\n      objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I\\r\\n      am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marrying\\r\\n      her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and\\r\\n      uncles. And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sister? Is _her_\\r\\n      husband, who is the son of his late father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steward, to be his\\r\\n      brother? Heaven and earth!\\xe2\\x80\\x94of what are you thinking? Are the\\r\\n      shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can _now_ have nothing further to say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she resentfully\\r\\n      answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have insulted me in every possible method. I must\\r\\n      beg to return to the house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they\\r\\n      turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\\r\\n      nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a\\r\\n      connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my\\r\\n      sentiments.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are then resolved to have him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that\\r\\n      manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\\r\\n      without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly\\r\\n      unconnected with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey\\r\\n      the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to\\r\\n      ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the\\r\\n      contempt of the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNeither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No\\r\\n      principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the\\r\\n      indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his\\r\\n      marrying me, it would not give me one moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concern\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the\\r\\n      world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very\\r\\n      well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet,\\r\\n      that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I\\r\\n      hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry\\r\\n      my point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\\r\\n      door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\n      take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\\r\\n      mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously\\r\\n      displeased.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\\r\\n      ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\\r\\n      herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up\\r\\n      stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\\r\\n      dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again\\r\\n      and rest herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe did not choose it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her daughter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe would go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was\\r\\n      prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the\\r\\n      Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say,\\r\\n      and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call\\r\\n      on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you,\\r\\n      Lizzy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to\\r\\n      acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 57\\r\\n\\r\\n      The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\\r\\n      Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for\\r\\n      many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady\\r\\n      Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this\\r\\n      journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her\\r\\n      supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to\\r\\n      be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could\\r\\n      originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she\\r\\n      recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and\\r\\n      _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\\r\\n      expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to\\r\\n      supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the\\r\\n      marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.\\r\\n      And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their\\r\\n      communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had\\r\\n      reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost\\r\\n      certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as\\r\\n      possible at some future time.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In revolving Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expressions, however, she could not\\r\\n      help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of\\r\\n      her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of\\r\\n      her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\\r\\n      Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\\r\\n      and how he might take a similar representation of the evils\\r\\n      attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She\\r\\n      knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his\\r\\n      dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he\\r\\n      thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\\r\\n      was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with\\r\\n      _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own,\\r\\n      his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions\\r\\n      of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to\\r\\n      Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good\\r\\n      sense and solid reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\n      If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had\\r\\n      often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a\\r\\n      relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\\r\\n      be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case\\r\\n      he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way\\r\\n      through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to\\r\\n      Netherfield must give way.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come\\r\\n      to his friend within a few days,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall know how to\\r\\n      understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every\\r\\n      wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting\\r\\n      me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall\\r\\n      soon cease to regret him at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\\r\\n      visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\\r\\n      it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on\\r\\n      the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her\\r\\n      father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was going to look for you; come into my\\r\\n      room.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had\\r\\n      to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in\\r\\n      some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck\\r\\n      her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated\\r\\n      with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\\r\\n      down. He then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\r\\n      exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to\\r\\n      know its contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_\\r\\n      daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a\\r\\n      very important conquest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      The colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cheeks in the\\r\\n      instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\\r\\n      instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be\\r\\n      pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his\\r\\n      letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\\r\\n      continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such\\r\\n      matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to\\r\\n      discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr.\\r\\n      Collins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething very much to the purpose of course. He begins with\\r\\n      congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest\\r\\n      daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\\r\\n      good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your\\r\\n      impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates\\r\\n      to yourself, is as follows: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Having thus offered you the sincere\\r\\n      congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event,\\r\\n      let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which\\r\\n      we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\\r\\n      Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet,\\r\\n      after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of\\r\\n      her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most\\r\\n      illustrious personages in this land.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? \\xe2\\x80\\x98This young\\r\\n      gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the\\r\\n      heart of mortal can most desire,\\xe2\\x80\\x94splendid property, noble\\r\\n      kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these\\r\\n      temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of\\r\\n      what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this\\r\\n      gentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to\\r\\n      take immediate advantage of.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it\\r\\n      comes out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to\\r\\n      imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on\\r\\n      the match with a friendly eye.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\\r\\n      surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man\\r\\n      within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have\\r\\n      given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy,\\r\\n      who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who\\r\\n      probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth tried to join in her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pleasantry, but could\\r\\n      only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been\\r\\n      directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you not diverted?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes. Pray read on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\\r\\n      ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\\r\\n      condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it\\r\\n      became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on\\r\\n      the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what\\r\\n      she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give\\r\\n      the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her\\r\\n      noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\\r\\n      hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n      Mr. Collins moreover adds, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I am truly rejoiced that my cousin\\r\\n      Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only\\r\\n      concerned that their living together before the marriage took\\r\\n      place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect\\r\\n      the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement\\r\\n      at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as\\r\\n      soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and\\r\\n      had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously\\r\\n      have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a\\r\\n      Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\\r\\n      names to be mentioned in your hearing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 _That_ is his notion of\\r\\n      Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his\\r\\n      dear Charlotte\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation, and his expectation of a young\\r\\n      olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.\\r\\n      You are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be\\r\\n      affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make\\r\\n      sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am excessively diverted. But it is so\\r\\n      strange!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x94_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other\\r\\n      man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference,\\r\\n      and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much\\r\\n      as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter\\r\\n      of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over\\r\\n      Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my\\r\\n      son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this\\r\\n      report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as\\r\\n      it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\\r\\n      distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at\\r\\n      a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was\\r\\n      necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father\\r\\n      had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want\\r\\n      of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too\\r\\n      _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 58\\r\\n\\r\\n      Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,\\r\\n      as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to\\r\\n      bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed\\r\\n      after Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and,\\r\\n      before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his\\r\\n      aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who\\r\\n      wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It\\r\\n      was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary\\r\\n      could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.\\r\\n      Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip\\r\\n      them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were\\r\\n      to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty\\r\\n      was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly\\r\\n      forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the\\r\\n      same.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\\r\\n      upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a\\r\\n      general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him\\r\\n      alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and,\\r\\n      while her courage was high, she immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of\\r\\n      giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be\\r\\n      wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your\\r\\n      unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known\\r\\n      it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully\\r\\n      I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not\\r\\n      have merely my own gratitude to express.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, in a tone of\\r\\n      surprise and emotion, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you have ever been informed of what\\r\\n      may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not\\r\\n      think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must not blame my aunt. Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thoughtlessness first\\r\\n      betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of\\r\\n      course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me\\r\\n      thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that\\r\\n      generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble,\\r\\n      and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering\\r\\n      them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you _will_ thank me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet it be for yourself\\r\\n      alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force\\r\\n      to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to\\r\\n      deny. But your _family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I\\r\\n      believe I thought only of _you_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short\\r\\n      pause, her companion added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are too generous to trifle with\\r\\n      me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me\\r\\n      so at once. _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one\\r\\n      word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and\\r\\n      anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and\\r\\n      immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand\\r\\n      that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the\\r\\n      period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude\\r\\n      and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this\\r\\n      reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before;\\r\\n      and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\\r\\n      warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had\\r\\n      Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how\\r\\n      well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face,\\r\\n      became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and\\r\\n      he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she\\r\\n      was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too\\r\\n      much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any\\r\\n      other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their\\r\\n      present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_\\r\\n      call on him in her return through London, and there relate her\\r\\n      journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her\\r\\n      conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every\\r\\n      expression of the latter which, in her ladyship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apprehension,\\r\\n      peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief\\r\\n      that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that\\r\\n      promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But,\\r\\n      unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly\\r\\n      contrariwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt taught me to hope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas I had scarcely ever allowed\\r\\n      myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be\\r\\n      certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided\\r\\n      against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine,\\r\\n      frankly and openly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, you know\\r\\n      enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After\\r\\n      abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple\\r\\n      in abusing you to all your relations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\\r\\n      accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my\\r\\n      behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It\\r\\n      was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to\\r\\n      that evening,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe conduct of neither, if\\r\\n      strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we\\r\\n      have both, I hope, improved in civility.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of\\r\\n      what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions\\r\\n      during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,\\r\\n      inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I\\r\\n      shall never forget: \\xe2\\x80\\x98had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike\\r\\n      manner.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely\\r\\n      conceive, how they have tortured me;\\xe2\\x80\\x94though it was some time, I\\r\\n      confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong\\r\\n      an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever\\r\\n      felt in such a way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every\\r\\n      proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I\\r\\n      shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed\\r\\n      you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not\\r\\n      do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily\\r\\n      ashamed of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy mentioned his letter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid it soon make\\r\\n      you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit\\r\\n      to its contents?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually\\r\\n      all her former prejudices had been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat what I wrote must give you pain, but it\\r\\n      was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was\\r\\n      one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your\\r\\n      having the power of reading again. I can remember some\\r\\n      expressions which might justly make you hate me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential\\r\\n      to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason\\r\\n      to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I\\r\\n      hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I wrote that letter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believed myself\\r\\n      perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was\\r\\n      written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.\\r\\n      The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The\\r\\n      feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it,\\r\\n      are now so widely different from what they were then, that every\\r\\n      unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You\\r\\n      must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its\\r\\n      remembrance gives you pleasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\\r\\n      retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the\\r\\n      contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is\\r\\n      much better, of innocence. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful\\r\\n      recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be\\r\\n      repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,\\r\\n      though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was\\r\\n      _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given\\r\\n      good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\\r\\n      Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), I was\\r\\n      spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,\\r\\n      particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed,\\r\\n      encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to\\r\\n      care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all\\r\\n      the rest of the world; to _wish_ at least to think meanly of\\r\\n      their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from\\r\\n      eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but\\r\\n      for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You\\r\\n      taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.\\r\\n      By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of\\r\\n      my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\\r\\n      pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHad you then persuaded yourself that I should?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you\\r\\n      to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I\\r\\n      assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might\\r\\n      often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_\\r\\n      evening?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began\\r\\n      to take a proper direction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met\\r\\n      at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed\\r\\n      by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary\\r\\n      politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_\\r\\n      than my due.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy object _then_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Darcy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas to show you, by every\\r\\n      civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the\\r\\n      past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill\\r\\n      opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended\\r\\n      to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly\\r\\n      tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then told her of Georgiana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delight in her acquaintance, and\\r\\n      of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally\\r\\n      leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that\\r\\n      his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her\\r\\n      sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his\\r\\n      gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other\\r\\n      struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\\r\\n      subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy\\r\\n      to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their\\r\\n      watches, that it was time to be at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was a wonder which\\r\\n      introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted\\r\\n      with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest\\r\\n      information of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must ask whether you were surprised?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as\\r\\n      much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had\\r\\n      been pretty much the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the evening before my going to London,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI made a\\r\\n      confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.\\r\\n      I told him of all that had occurred to make my former\\r\\n      interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise\\r\\n      was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him,\\r\\n      moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had\\r\\n      done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could\\r\\n      easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt\\r\\n      no doubt of their happiness together.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing\\r\\n      his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you speak from your own observation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen you\\r\\n      told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information\\r\\n      last spring?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two\\r\\n      visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her\\r\\n      affection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\\r\\n      conviction to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\\r\\n      prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case,\\r\\n      but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to\\r\\n      confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended\\r\\n      him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had\\r\\n      been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and\\r\\n      purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am\\r\\n      persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your\\r\\n      sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most\\r\\n      delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\\r\\n      invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had\\r\\n      yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to\\r\\n      begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course\\r\\n      was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation\\r\\n      till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 59\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was a\\r\\n      question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she\\r\\n      entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to\\r\\n      table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered\\r\\n      about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she\\r\\n      spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion\\r\\n      of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.\\r\\n      The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged\\r\\n      were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness\\r\\n      overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather\\r\\n      _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for,\\r\\n      besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils\\r\\n      before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when\\r\\n      her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him\\r\\n      but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_\\r\\n      which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very\\r\\n      far from Miss Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general habits, she was absolutely\\r\\n      incredulous here.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!\\xe2\\x80\\x94engaged to Mr. Darcy! No,\\r\\n      no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on\\r\\n      you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.\\r\\n      Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He\\r\\n      still loves me, and we are engaged.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane looked at her doubtingly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know\\r\\n      how much you dislike him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot.\\r\\n      Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in\\r\\n      such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the\\r\\n      last time I shall ever remember it myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\\r\\n      seriously assured her of its truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n      cried Jane. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, dear Lizzy, I would\\xe2\\x80\\x94I do congratulate\\r\\n      you\\xe2\\x80\\x94but are you certain? forgive the question\\xe2\\x80\\x94are you quite\\r\\n      certain that you can be happy with him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already,\\r\\n      that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you\\r\\n      pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself\\r\\n      more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as\\r\\n      impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh,\\r\\n      Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you\\r\\n      quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do,\\r\\n      when I tell you all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I\\r\\n      am afraid you will be angry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very\\r\\n      seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without\\r\\n      delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\\r\\n      began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his\\r\\n      beautiful grounds at Pemberley.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\\r\\n      desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn\\r\\n      assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss\\r\\n      Bennet had nothing further to wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I am quite happy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor you will be as happy as\\r\\n      myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his\\r\\n      love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as\\r\\n      Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and\\r\\n      yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very\\r\\n      reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at\\r\\n      Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,\\r\\n      not to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been\\r\\n      unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own\\r\\n      feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But\\r\\n      now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in\\r\\n      conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood gracious!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the\\r\\n      next morning, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here\\r\\n      again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so\\r\\n      tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he\\r\\n      would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us\\r\\n      with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk\\r\\n      out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;\\r\\n      yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him\\r\\n      such an epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,\\r\\n      and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good\\r\\n      information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way\\r\\n      again to-day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Bennet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto\\r\\n      walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may do very well for the others,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Bingley; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I\\r\\n      am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it, Kitty?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kitty\\r\\n      owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\\r\\n      curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\\r\\n      consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      followed her, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\\r\\n      disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind\\r\\n      it: it is all for Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, you know; and there is no occasion\\r\\n      for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put\\r\\n      yourself to inconvenience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consent\\r\\n      should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved\\r\\n      to herself the application for her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. She could not\\r\\n      determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting\\r\\n      whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome\\r\\n      her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set\\r\\n      against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain\\r\\n      that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her\\r\\n      sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\\r\\n      first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\\r\\n      disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,\\r\\n      she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on\\r\\n      seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opposition,\\r\\n      but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be\\r\\n      through her means\\xe2\\x80\\x94that _she_, his favourite child, should be\\r\\n      distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears\\r\\n      and regrets in disposing of her\\xe2\\x80\\x94was a wretched reflection, and\\r\\n      she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at\\r\\n      him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he\\r\\n      approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\\r\\n      pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo to your\\r\\n      father, he wants you in the library.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She was gone directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat are you doing? Are you out of your\\r\\n      senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been\\r\\n      more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have\\r\\n      spared her from explanations and professions which it was\\r\\n      exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she\\r\\n      assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich,\\r\\n      to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages\\r\\n      than Jane. But will they make you happy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you any other objection,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthan your belief\\r\\n      of my indifference?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of\\r\\n      man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do, I do like him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied, with tears in her eyes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\n      love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly\\r\\n      amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain\\r\\n      me by speaking of him in such terms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLizzy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her father, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have given him my consent. He is the\\r\\n      kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,\\r\\n      which he condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are\\r\\n      resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of\\r\\n      it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be\\r\\n      neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your\\r\\n      husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively\\r\\n      talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal\\r\\n      marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My\\r\\n      child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to\\r\\n      respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her\\r\\n      reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was\\r\\n      really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change\\r\\n      which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute\\r\\n      certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had\\r\\n      stood the test of many months\\xe2\\x80\\x99 suspense, and enumerating with\\r\\n      energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, when she ceased speaking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no\\r\\n      more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not\\r\\n      have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with\\r\\n      astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every\\r\\n      thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will\\r\\n      save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n      doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young\\r\\n      lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him\\r\\n      to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and\\r\\n      there will be an end of the matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\\r\\n      reading Mr. Collins\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter; and after laughing at her some\\r\\n      time, allowed her at last to go\\xe2\\x80\\x94saying, as she quitted the room,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am\\r\\n      quite at leisure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,\\r\\n      after half an hour\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quiet reflection in her own room, she was\\r\\n      able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was\\r\\n      too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away;\\r\\n      there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the\\r\\n      comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she\\r\\n      followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect\\r\\n      was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat\\r\\n      quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under\\r\\n      many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard;\\r\\n      though not in general backward to credit what was for the\\r\\n      advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to\\r\\n      any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\\r\\n      her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!\\r\\n      Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest\\r\\n      Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what\\r\\n      jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is nothing to\\r\\n      it\\xe2\\x80\\x94nothing at all. I am so pleased\\xe2\\x80\\x94so happy. Such a charming\\r\\n      man!\\xe2\\x80\\x94so handsome! so tall!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for\\r\\n      my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook\\r\\n      it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is\\r\\n      charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!\\r\\n      What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\\r\\n      doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard\\r\\n      only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three\\r\\n      minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dearest child,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can think of nothing else! Ten\\r\\n      thousand a year, and very likely more! \\xe2\\x80\\x99Tis as good as a Lord!\\r\\n      And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special\\r\\n      licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is\\r\\n      particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was a sad omen of what her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behaviour to the\\r\\n      gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in\\r\\n      the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of\\r\\n      her relations\\xe2\\x80\\x99 consent, there was still something to be wished\\r\\n      for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law\\r\\n      that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power\\r\\n      to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his\\r\\n      opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains\\r\\n      to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that\\r\\n      he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWickham,\\r\\n      perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband\\r\\n      quite as well as Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 60\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow could you begin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can comprehend your going on\\r\\n      charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could\\r\\n      set you off in the first place?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\\r\\n      words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in\\r\\n      the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners\\xe2\\x80\\x94my\\r\\n      behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil,\\r\\n      and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain\\r\\n      than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the liveliness of your mind, I did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little\\r\\n      less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference,\\r\\n      of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who\\r\\n      were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_\\r\\n      approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so\\r\\n      unlike _them_. Had you not been really amiable, you would have\\r\\n      hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise\\r\\n      yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your\\r\\n      heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\\r\\n      courted you. There\\xe2\\x80\\x94I have saved you the trouble of accounting for\\r\\n      it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it\\r\\n      perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of\\r\\n      me\\xe2\\x80\\x94but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\\r\\n      she was ill at Netherfield?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a\\r\\n      virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your\\r\\n      protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;\\r\\n      and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing\\r\\n      and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin\\r\\n      directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the\\r\\n      point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called,\\r\\n      and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did\\r\\n      you look as if you did not care about me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause you were grave and silent, and gave me no\\r\\n      encouragement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I was embarrassed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so was I.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA man who had felt less, might.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\\r\\n      and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder\\r\\n      how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to\\r\\n      yourself. I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not\\r\\n      asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to\\r\\n      Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too much_, I am afraid; for\\r\\n      what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach\\r\\n      of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This\\r\\n      will never do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly\\r\\n      fair. Lady Catherine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us\\r\\n      were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for\\r\\n      my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your\\r\\n      gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of\\r\\n      yours. My aunt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intelligence had given me hope, and I was\\r\\n      determined at once to know every thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her\\r\\n      happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come\\r\\n      down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and\\r\\n      be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious\\r\\n      consequence?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could,\\r\\n      whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or\\r\\n      what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were\\r\\n      still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession\\r\\n      to him which I have since made.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what\\r\\n      is to befall her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am more likely to want  time than courage, Elizabeth. But it\\r\\n      ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it\\r\\n      shall be done directly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\\r\\n      and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady\\r\\n      once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer\\r\\n      neglected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate\\r\\n      which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to\\r\\n      find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of\\r\\n      happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to\\r\\n      have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\\r\\n      particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You\\r\\n      supposed more than really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as\\r\\n      you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your\\r\\n      imagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\r\\n      afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot\\r\\n      greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\r\\n      great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and\\r\\n      again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to\\r\\n      wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round\\r\\n      the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world.\\r\\n      Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such\\r\\n      justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare\\r\\n      from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours,\\r\\n      etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;\\r\\n      and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, in reply to his last.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Sir,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will\\r\\n      soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as\\r\\n      you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has\\r\\n      more to give.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYours sincerely, etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\\r\\n      marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote\\r\\n      even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat\\r\\n      all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but\\r\\n      she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could\\r\\n      not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was\\r\\n      deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar\\r\\n      information, was as sincere as her brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in sending it. Four\\r\\n      sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and\\r\\n      all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any\\r\\n      congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family\\r\\n      heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The\\r\\n      reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine\\r\\n      had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her\\r\\n      nephew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match,\\r\\n      was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a\\r\\n      moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to\\r\\n      Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must\\r\\n      sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\\r\\n      husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could\\r\\n      even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on\\r\\n      carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed\\r\\n      his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, with\\r\\n      very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not\\r\\n      till Sir William was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Phillips\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax\\r\\n      on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her\\r\\n      sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the\\r\\n      familiarity which Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever\\r\\n      she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him,\\r\\n      though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more\\r\\n      elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the\\r\\n      frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to\\r\\n      herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\\r\\n      without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\n      arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of\\r\\n      its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked\\r\\n      forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from\\r\\n      society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and\\r\\n      elegance of their family party at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 61\\r\\n\\r\\n      Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what\\r\\n      delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked\\r\\n      of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake\\r\\n      of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in\\r\\n      the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an\\r\\n      effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman\\r\\n      for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her\\r\\n      husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so\\r\\n      unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and\\r\\n      invariably silly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection\\r\\n      for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.\\r\\n      He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least\\r\\n      expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.\\r\\n      So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not\\r\\n      desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.\\r\\n      The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an\\r\\n      estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and\\r\\n      Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were\\r\\n      within thirty miles of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\\r\\n      time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what\\r\\n      she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not\\r\\n      of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the\\r\\n      influence of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s example, she became, by proper attention and\\r\\n      management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From\\r\\n      the further disadvantage of Lydia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s society she was of course\\r\\n      carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to\\r\\n      come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men,\\r\\n      her father would never consent to her going.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\\r\\n      necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix\\r\\n      more with the world, but she could still moralize over every\\r\\n      morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons\\r\\n      between her sisters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 beauty and her own, it was suspected by her\\r\\n      father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution\\r\\n      from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the\\r\\n      conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with\\r\\n      whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown\\r\\n      to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope\\r\\n      that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The\\r\\n      congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her\\r\\n      marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by\\r\\n      himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this\\r\\n      effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Lizzy,\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my\\r\\n      dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to\\r\\n      have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope\\r\\n      you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at\\r\\n      court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money\\r\\n      enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of\\r\\n      about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\r\\n\\r\\n      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYours, etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n      As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she\\r\\n      endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and\\r\\n      expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her\\r\\n      power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy\\r\\n      in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had\\r\\n      always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under\\r\\n      the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and\\r\\n      heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their\\r\\n      support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\\r\\n      herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance\\r\\n      towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even\\r\\n      when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was\\r\\n      unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to\\r\\n      place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more\\r\\n      than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into\\r\\n      indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her\\r\\n      youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation\\r\\n      which her marriage had given her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, he assisted him further in his profession.\\r\\n      Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone\\r\\n      to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they\\r\\n      both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good\\r\\n      humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of\\r\\n      giving them a hint to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marriage; but\\r\\n      as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at\\r\\n      Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of\\r\\n      Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid\\r\\n      off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Pemberley was now Georgiana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home; and the attachment of the\\r\\n      sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able\\r\\n      to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had\\r\\n      the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first\\r\\n      she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her\\r\\n      lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had\\r\\n      always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her\\r\\n      affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind\\r\\n      received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By\\r\\n      Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman\\r\\n      may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not\\r\\n      always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than\\r\\n      himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\\r\\n      nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her\\r\\n      character in her reply to the letter which announced its\\r\\n      arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of\\r\\n      Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But\\r\\n      at length, by Elizabeth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s persuasion, he was prevailed on to\\r\\n      overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a\\r\\n      little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment\\r\\n      gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to\\r\\n      see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait\\r\\n      on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods\\r\\n      had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress,\\r\\n      but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.\\r\\n      Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were\\r\\n      both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons\\r\\n      who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of\\r\\n      uniting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

              "'\\r\\n\\r\\n      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in\\r\\n      possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be\\r\\n      on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well\\r\\n      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is\\r\\n      considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their\\r\\n      daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you\\r\\n      heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and\\r\\n      she told me all about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife\\r\\n      impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was invitation enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is\\r\\n      taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;\\r\\n      that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the\\r\\n      place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr.\\r\\n      Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before\\r\\n      Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by\\r\\n      the end of next week.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What is his name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Bingley.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Is he married or single?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;\\r\\n      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How so? how can it affect them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so\\r\\n      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\\r\\n      them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Is that his design in settling here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\\r\\n      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\r\\n      must visit him as soon as he comes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\\r\\n      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\\r\\n      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you\\r\\n      the best of the party.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\\r\\n      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\r\\n      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\\r\\n      thinking of her own beauty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\\r\\n      comes into the neighbourhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\\r\\n      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\\r\\n      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\\r\\n      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\\r\\n      impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\\r\\n      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\r\\n      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\r\\n      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\\r\\n      little Lizzy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\\r\\n      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\r\\n      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\r\\n      giving _her_ the preference.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;\\r\\n      “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\r\\n      something more of quickness than her sisters.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\\r\\n      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor\\r\\n      nerves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\\r\\n      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\\r\\n      consideration these twenty years at least.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\\r\\n      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\\r\\n      will not visit them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\\r\\n      visit them all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\r\\n      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\\r\\n      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\\r\\n      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\\r\\n      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\\r\\n      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\\r\\n      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\\r\\n      solace was visiting and news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\r\\n      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\r\\n      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\\r\\n      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\\r\\n      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\\r\\n      with,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her\\r\\n      mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him\\r\\n      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\\r\\n      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\r\\n      have no opinion of her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that\\r\\n      you do not depend on her serving you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\\r\\n      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\\r\\n      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she\\r\\n      times them ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.\\r\\n      “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “To-morrow fortnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come\\r\\n      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to\\r\\n      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\r\\n      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\r\\n      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is\\r\\n      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\\r\\n      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\\r\\n      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\\r\\n      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\\r\\n      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\r\\n      “Nonsense, nonsense!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.\\r\\n      “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that\\r\\n      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you\\r\\n      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep\\r\\n      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return\\r\\n      to Mr. Bingley.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so\\r\\n      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not\\r\\n      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\r\\n      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first\\r\\n      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\r\\n      had expected all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\r\\n      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\r\\n      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\r\\n      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and\\r\\n      never said a word about it till now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.\\r\\n      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\r\\n      raptures of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the\\r\\n      door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends\\r\\n      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of\\r\\n      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\r\\n      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\r\\n      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare\\r\\n      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\r\\n      youngest, I’m the tallest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\r\\n      would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should\\r\\n      ask him to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n\\r\\n      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\r\\n      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\r\\n      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\r\\n      They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,\\r\\n      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\r\\n      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the\\r\\n      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\\r\\n      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\\r\\n      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\r\\n      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\\r\\n      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\\r\\n      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\\r\\n      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\r\\n      Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the\\r\\n      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat\\r\\n      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\\r\\n      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\\r\\n      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\\r\\n      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\\r\\n      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and\\r\\n      rode a black horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\r\\n      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\r\\n      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\\r\\n      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\\r\\n      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their\\r\\n      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\\r\\n      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his\\r\\n      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be\\r\\n      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\\r\\n      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\\r\\n      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\\r\\n      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with\\r\\n      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of\\r\\n      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,\\r\\n      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from\\r\\n      London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered\\r\\n      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another\\r\\n      young man.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\r\\n      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine\\r\\n      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.\\r\\n      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\\r\\n      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\\r\\n      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general\\r\\n      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\\r\\n      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\\r\\n      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\\r\\n      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\\r\\n      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to\\r\\n      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\\r\\n      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\r\\n      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\\r\\n      compared with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\r\\n      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\r\\n      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and\\r\\n      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\\r\\n      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him\\r\\n      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and\\r\\n      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\\r\\n      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the\\r\\n      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His\\r\\n      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\r\\n      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\\r\\n      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\\r\\n      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\\r\\n      daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\\r\\n      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a\\r\\n      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance\\r\\n      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\r\\n      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much\\r\\n      better dance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\r\\n      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as\\r\\n      this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and\\r\\n      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\r\\n      punishment to me to stand up with.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley,\\r\\n      “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant\\r\\n      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of\\r\\n      them you see uncommonly pretty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there\\r\\n      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very\\r\\n      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner\\r\\n      to introduce you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\\r\\n      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly\\r\\n      said, “She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I\\r\\n      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies\\r\\n      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your\\r\\n      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with\\r\\n      me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\r\\n      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She\\r\\n      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for\\r\\n      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\\r\\n      anything ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\\r\\n      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she\\r\\n      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified\\r\\n      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned\\r\\n      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\\r\\n      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough\\r\\n      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet\\r\\n      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\r\\n      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which\\r\\n      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still\\r\\n      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\\r\\n      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\\r\\n      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had\\r\\n      rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be\\r\\n      disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story\\r\\n      to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a\\r\\n      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had\\r\\n      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\r\\n      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her\\r\\n      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,\\r\\n      my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only\\r\\n      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,\\r\\n      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;\\r\\n      but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,\\r\\n      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\r\\n      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,\\r\\n      and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with\\r\\n      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth\\r\\n      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\\r\\n      _Boulanger_—”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband\\r\\n      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s\\r\\n      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his\\r\\n      ankle in the first dance!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\\r\\n      handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life\\r\\n      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace\\r\\n      upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\r\\n      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another\\r\\n      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of\\r\\n      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much\\r\\n      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid\\r\\n      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that\\r\\n      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,\\r\\n      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance\\r\\n      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one\\r\\n      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\r\\n      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\r\\n      sister how very much she admired him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\\r\\n      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so\\r\\n      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man\\r\\n      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\\r\\n      thereby complete.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\r\\n      time. I did not expect such a compliment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference\\r\\n      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_\\r\\n      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He\\r\\n      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as\\r\\n      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for\\r\\n      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave\\r\\n      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Dear Lizzy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\r\\n      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good\\r\\n      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a\\r\\n      human being in my life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always\\r\\n      speak what I think.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With\\r\\n      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\r\\n      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;—one\\r\\n      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or\\r\\n      design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it\\r\\n      still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.\\r\\n      And so, you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners\\r\\n      are not equal to his.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when\\r\\n      you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,\\r\\n      and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a\\r\\n      very charming neighbour in her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\r\\n      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\r\\n      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\r\\n      of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by\\r\\n      any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\r\\n      them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\r\\n      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of\\r\\n      being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\\r\\n      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first\\r\\n      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\r\\n      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and\\r\\n      of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every\\r\\n      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of\\r\\n      others. They were of a respectable family in the north of\\r\\n      England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories\\r\\n      than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired\\r\\n      by trade.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\r\\n      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\\r\\n      estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it\\r\\n      likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was\\r\\n      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was\\r\\n      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his\\r\\n      temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at\\r\\n      Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\n      His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own;\\r\\n      but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\r\\n      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.\\r\\n      Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\r\\n      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by\\r\\n      an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did\\r\\n      look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the\\r\\n      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner\\r\\n      said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\r\\n      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to\\r\\n      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\r\\n      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\r\\n      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the\\r\\n      strength of Darcy’s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\r\\n      of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was\\r\\n      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was\\r\\n      clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\r\\n      fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.\\r\\n      In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was\\r\\n      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\r\\n      giving offence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\r\\n      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with\\r\\n      pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\r\\n      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\r\\n      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as\\r\\n      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\r\\n      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\r\\n      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\r\\n      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either\\r\\n      attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\r\\n      but she smiled too much.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they\\r\\n      admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,\\r\\n      and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet\\r\\n      was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt\\r\\n      authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n\\r\\n      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the\\r\\n      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been\\r\\n      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable\\r\\n      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to\\r\\n      the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been\\r\\n      felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business\\r\\n      and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting\\r\\n      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile\\r\\n      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\\r\\n      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled\\r\\n      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the\\r\\n      world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\\r\\n      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.\\r\\n      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation\\r\\n      at St. James’s had made him courteous.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\r\\n      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The\\r\\n      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about\\r\\n      twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk\\r\\n      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the\\r\\n      assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\r\\n      communicate.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with\\r\\n      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first\\r\\n      choice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.\\r\\n      To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather\\r\\n      believe he _did_—I heard something about it—but I hardly know\\r\\n      what—something about Mr. Robinson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;\\r\\n      did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he\\r\\n      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there\\r\\n      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he\\r\\n      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last\\r\\n      question—‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt, there\\r\\n      cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Upon my word! Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem\\r\\n      as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,”\\r\\n      said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as\\r\\n      his friend, is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just _tolerable_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\\r\\n      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would\\r\\n      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last\\r\\n      night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once\\r\\n      opening his lips.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said\\r\\n      Jane. “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and\\r\\n      he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very\\r\\n      angry at being spoke to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much\\r\\n      unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is\\r\\n      remarkably agreeable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\r\\n      agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how\\r\\n      it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare\\r\\n      say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,\\r\\n      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas,\\r\\n      “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with\\r\\n      _him_, if I were you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with\\r\\n      him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as\\r\\n      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot\\r\\n      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\r\\n      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I\\r\\n      may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily\\r\\n      forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of\\r\\n      her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\r\\n      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\r\\n      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\r\\n      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\r\\n      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\r\\n      imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\r\\n      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without\\r\\n      being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,\\r\\n      vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came\\r\\n      with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would\\r\\n      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\r\\n      your bottle directly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\r\\n      that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n\\r\\n      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The\\r\\n      visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing\\r\\n      manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and\\r\\n      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger\\r\\n      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted\\r\\n      with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this\\r\\n      attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth\\r\\n      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,\\r\\n      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though\\r\\n      their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\r\\n      all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.\\r\\n      It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire\\r\\n      her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to\\r\\n      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the\\r\\n      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she\\r\\n      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered\\r\\n      by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength\\r\\n      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of\\r\\n      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the\\r\\n      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to\\r\\n      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\r\\n      disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her\\r\\n      affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\r\\n      the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\r\\n      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so\\r\\n      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it\\r\\n      is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely—a\\r\\n      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\r\\n      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.\\r\\n      In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection\\r\\n      than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may\\r\\n      never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If\\r\\n      _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton\\r\\n      indeed not to discover it too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you\\r\\n      do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\r\\n      conceal it, he must find it out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley\\r\\n      and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours\\r\\n      together; and as they always see each other in large mixed\\r\\n      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in\\r\\n      conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every\\r\\n      half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is\\r\\n      secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as\\r\\n      much as she chooses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is\\r\\n      in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were\\r\\n      determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\r\\n      should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not\\r\\n      acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\r\\n      degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known\\r\\n      him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;\\r\\n      she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined\\r\\n      in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make\\r\\n      her understand his character.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she\\r\\n      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\r\\n      you must remember that four evenings have been also spent\\r\\n      together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\r\\n      they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to\\r\\n      any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has\\r\\n      been unfolded.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\r\\n      and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had\\r\\n      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his\\r\\n      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a\\r\\n      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so\\r\\n      well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does\\r\\n      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to\\r\\n      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of\\r\\n      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the\\r\\n      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it\\r\\n      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,\\r\\n      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\r\\n      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\r\\n      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\r\\n      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it\\r\\n      clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good\\r\\n      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\r\\n      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark\\r\\n      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\\r\\n      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure\\r\\n      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her\\r\\n      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting\\r\\n      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was\\r\\n      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly\\r\\n      unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable\\r\\n      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance\\r\\n      with.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\r\\n      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\r\\n      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William\\r\\n      Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening\\r\\n      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\r\\n      see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do\\r\\n      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid\\r\\n      of him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming\\r\\n      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend\\r\\n      to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking\\r\\n      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\\r\\n      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a\\r\\n      ball at Meryton?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\\r\\n      energetic.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are severe on us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am\\r\\n      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always\\r\\n      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my\\r\\n      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;\\r\\n      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who\\r\\n      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On\\r\\n      Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well; if it\\r\\n      must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There\\r\\n      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar\\r\\n      with—‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’—and I shall keep\\r\\n      mine to swell my song.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a\\r\\n      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of\\r\\n      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at\\r\\n      the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of\\r\\n      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge\\r\\n      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\r\\n      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\r\\n      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\r\\n      excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\r\\n      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing\\r\\n      half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad\\r\\n      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the\\r\\n      request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases,\\r\\n      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end\\r\\n      of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\r\\n      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\r\\n      was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir\\r\\n      William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\\r\\n      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of\\r\\n      the first refinements of polished societies.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\r\\n      amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Every savage\\r\\n      can dance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\\r\\n      continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I\\r\\n      doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\r\\n      sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Never, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid\\r\\n      it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You have a house in town, I conclude?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am\\r\\n      fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that\\r\\n      the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\r\\n      disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\r\\n      towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very\\r\\n      gallant thing, and called out to her,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must\\r\\n      allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable\\r\\n      partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much\\r\\n      beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given\\r\\n      it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not\\r\\n      unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said\\r\\n      with some discomposure to Sir William,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I\\r\\n      entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg\\r\\n      for a partner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\\r\\n      honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor\\r\\n      did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\\r\\n      persuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\\r\\n      deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\\r\\n      dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am\\r\\n      sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He is, indeed—but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\\r\\n      Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object\\r\\n      to such a partner?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\\r\\n      injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with\\r\\n      some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I should imagine not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\\r\\n      evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of\\r\\n      your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet\\r\\n      the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all\\r\\n      these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\\r\\n      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great\\r\\n      pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman\\r\\n      can bestow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired\\r\\n      he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\\r\\n      reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all\\r\\n      astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray\\r\\n      when am I to wish you joy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A\\r\\n      lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\\r\\n      love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be\\r\\n      wishing me joy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\\r\\n      absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,\\r\\n      indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with\\r\\n      you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\\r\\n      entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\\r\\n      her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\\r\\n      two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\\r\\n      entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and\\r\\n      their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,\\r\\n      could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been\\r\\n      an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\\r\\n      to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\\r\\n      settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\\r\\n      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\\r\\n      tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\\r\\n      their aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two\\r\\n      youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\\r\\n      frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\\r\\n      their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to\\r\\n      Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish\\r\\n      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the\\r\\n      country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\\r\\n      from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\\r\\n      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia\\r\\n      regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,\\r\\n      and Meryton was the headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most\\r\\n      interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their\\r\\n      knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings\\r\\n      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the\\r\\n      officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this\\r\\n      opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They\\r\\n      could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large\\r\\n      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was\\r\\n      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an\\r\\n      ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet coolly observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\\r\\n      be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it\\r\\n      some time, but I am now convinced.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with\\r\\n      perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\\r\\n      Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\\r\\n      day, as he was going the next morning to London.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be\\r\\n      so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think\\r\\n      slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own,\\r\\n      however.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of\\r\\n      it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\\r\\n      agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\\r\\n      particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\\r\\n      youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the\\r\\n      sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I\\r\\n      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\r\\n      I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,\\r\\n      indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,\\r\\n      with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I\\r\\n      shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked\\r\\n      very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his\\r\\n      regimentals.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\\r\\n      Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did\\r\\n      when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\\r\\n      Clarke’s library.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman\\r\\n      with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the\\r\\n      servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with\\r\\n      pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter\\r\\n      read,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?\\r\\n      Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “MY DEAR FRIEND,—\\r\\n      “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa\\r\\n      and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest\\r\\n      of our lives, for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women\\r\\n      can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the\\r\\n      receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with\\r\\n      the officers.—Yours ever,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “CAROLINE BINGLEY”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell\\r\\n      us of _that_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\\r\\n      likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure\\r\\n      that they would not offer to send her home.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to\\r\\n      Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I had much rather go in the coach.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\r\\n      They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s\\r\\n      purpose will be answered.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the\\r\\n      horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on\\r\\n      horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\\r\\n      cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane\\r\\n      had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were\\r\\n      uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued\\r\\n      the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not\\r\\n      come back.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more\\r\\n      than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.\\r\\n      Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the\\r\\n      felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a\\r\\n      servant from Netherfield brought the following note for\\r\\n      Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “MY DEAREST LIZZY,—\\r\\n      “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to\\r\\n      be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends\\r\\n      will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also\\r\\n      on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should\\r\\n      hear of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and\\r\\n      headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, &c.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\\r\\n      note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\\r\\n      illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\\r\\n      was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\\r\\n      trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she\\r\\n      stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I\\r\\n      could have the carriage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\r\\n      though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\r\\n      horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her\\r\\n      resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such\\r\\n      a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when\\r\\n      you get there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\\r\\n      horses?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\r\\n      nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back\\r\\n      by dinner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but\\r\\n      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\r\\n      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\r\\n      required.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and\\r\\n      Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\r\\n      ladies set off together.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we\\r\\n      may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings\\r\\n      of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk\\r\\n      alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over\\r\\n      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and\\r\\n      finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\r\\n      ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\r\\n      exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\\r\\n      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\\r\\n      surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the\\r\\n      day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible\\r\\n      to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that\\r\\n      they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very\\r\\n      politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was\\r\\n      something better than politeness; there was good humour and\\r\\n      kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at\\r\\n      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy\\r\\n      which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the\\r\\n      occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\r\\n      thinking only of his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\r\\n      Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\r\\n      not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken\\r\\n      to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the\\r\\n      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note\\r\\n      how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her\\r\\n      entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and\\r\\n      when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little\\r\\n      beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness\\r\\n      she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and\\r\\n      Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\r\\n      affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary\\r\\n      came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\r\\n      supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\r\\n      endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\r\\n      and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,\\r\\n      for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.\\r\\n      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other\\r\\n      ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\\r\\n      nothing to do elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\r\\n      very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\r\\n      and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\r\\n      testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\r\\n      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\r\\n      remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully\\r\\n      consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint\\r\\n      the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n\\r\\n      At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\r\\n      six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries\\r\\n      which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of\\r\\n      distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she\\r\\n      could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means\\r\\n      better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\r\\n      times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a\\r\\n      bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;\\r\\n      and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference\\r\\n      towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth\\r\\n      to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\r\\n      could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was\\r\\n      evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\r\\n      prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed\\r\\n      she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from\\r\\n      any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister\\r\\n      scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he\\r\\n      was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at\\r\\n      cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,\\r\\n      had nothing to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\r\\n      Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her\\r\\n      manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride\\r\\n      and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\r\\n      excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this\\r\\n      morning. She really looked almost wild.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.\\r\\n      Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering\\r\\n      about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so\\r\\n      untidy, so blowsy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\r\\n      deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been\\r\\n      let down to hide it not doing its office.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this\\r\\n      was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked\\r\\n      remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her\\r\\n      dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n      “and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your\\r\\n      sister_ make such an exhibition.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Certainly not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever\\r\\n      it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what\\r\\n      could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort\\r\\n      of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\r\\n      decorum.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,”\\r\\n      said Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half\\r\\n      whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration\\r\\n      of her fine eyes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.”\\r\\n      A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\r\\n      very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\r\\n      settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low\\r\\n      connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\r\\n      Meryton.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed\\r\\n      heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried\\r\\n      Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\r\\n      of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\r\\n      their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at\\r\\n      the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room\\r\\n      on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to\\r\\n      coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit\\r\\n      her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of\\r\\n      seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than\\r\\n      pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the\\r\\n      drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was\\r\\n      immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\r\\n      playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse,\\r\\n      said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\\r\\n      below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather\\r\\n      singular.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a\\r\\n      great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried\\r\\n      Elizabeth; “I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in\\r\\n      many things.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said\\r\\n      Bingley; “and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her\\r\\n      quite well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a\\r\\n      table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to\\r\\n      fetch her others; all that his library afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\r\\n      credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I\\r\\n      have more than I ever looked into.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\r\\n      those in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have\\r\\n      left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\r\\n      you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many\\r\\n      generations.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always\\r\\n      buying books.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\r\\n      as these.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\r\\n      beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_\\r\\n      house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I wish it may.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\r\\n      neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is\\r\\n      not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will\\r\\n      sell it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\r\\n      Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her\\r\\n      very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly\\r\\n      aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself\\r\\n      between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n      “will she be as tall as I am?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s\\r\\n      height, or rather taller.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\r\\n      delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners!—and so\\r\\n      extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the\\r\\n      pianoforte is exquisite.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have\\r\\n      patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\r\\n      mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens,\\r\\n      and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this,\\r\\n      and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\r\\n      time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy,\\r\\n      “has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who\\r\\n      deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a\\r\\n      screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your\\r\\n      estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more\\r\\n      than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that\\r\\n      are really accomplished.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in\\r\\n      your idea of an accomplished woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be\\r\\n      really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\r\\n      usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\r\\n      music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\r\\n      deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a\\r\\n      certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of\\r\\n      her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\r\\n      half deserved.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she\\r\\n      must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\r\\n      her mind by extensive reading.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished\\r\\n      women. I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility\\r\\n      of all this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and\\r\\n      taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\r\\n      of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\r\\n      many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called\\r\\n      them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to\\r\\n      what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an\\r\\n      end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed\\r\\n      on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend\\r\\n      themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with\\r\\n      many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a\\r\\n      paltry device, a very mean art.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\r\\n      addressed, “there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies\\r\\n      sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears\\r\\n      affinity to cunning is despicable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\r\\n      continue the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\r\\n      worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s\\r\\n      being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no\\r\\n      country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to\\r\\n      town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not\\r\\n      hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their\\r\\n      brother’s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be\\r\\n      sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly\\r\\n      better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared\\r\\n      that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\r\\n      however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better\\r\\n      relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions\\r\\n      that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her\\r\\n      sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and\\r\\n      in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\r\\n      answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\r\\n      elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this\\r\\n      amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\r\\n      Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\r\\n      judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched,\\r\\n      and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon\\r\\n      after the family breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have\\r\\n      been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her\\r\\n      illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\r\\n      immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\r\\n      her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her\\r\\n      daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\r\\n      apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\r\\n      advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\r\\n      Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\r\\n      daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley\\r\\n      met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\r\\n      worse than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too\\r\\n      ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\r\\n      We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister,\\r\\n      I am sure, will not hear of her removal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold\\r\\n      civility, “that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention\\r\\n      while she remains with us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do\\r\\n      not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\r\\n      and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\r\\n      world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\r\\n      exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell\\r\\n      my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room\\r\\n      here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.\\r\\n      I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\r\\n      Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\\r\\n      hope, though you have but a short lease.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if\\r\\n      I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\r\\n      five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\r\\n      fixed here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards\\r\\n      her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily\\r\\n      seen through I am afraid is pitiful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate\\r\\n      character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not\\r\\n      run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you\\r\\n      were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have\\r\\n      at least that advantage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few\\r\\n      subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in\\r\\n      a very confined and unvarying society.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new\\r\\n      to be observed in them for ever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of\\r\\n      mentioning a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite\\r\\n      as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\r\\n      moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had\\r\\n      gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\\r\\n      country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The\\r\\n      country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave\\r\\n      it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have\\r\\n      each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\r\\n      gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was\\r\\n      nothing at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for\\r\\n      her mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that\\r\\n      there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the\\r\\n      country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\\r\\n      meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there\\r\\n      are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with\\r\\n      four-and-twenty families.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\r\\n      his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her\\r\\n      eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth,\\r\\n      for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother’s\\r\\n      thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn\\r\\n      since _her_ coming away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man\\r\\n      Sir William is, Mr. Bingley—is not he? so much the man of\\r\\n      fashion! So genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to\\r\\n      everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons\\r\\n      who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths,\\r\\n      quite mistake the matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Did Charlotte dine with you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the\\r\\n      mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants\\r\\n      that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up\\r\\n      differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\r\\n      Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity\\r\\n      they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_\\r\\n      plain—but then she is our particular friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas\\r\\n      herself has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not\\r\\n      like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not\\r\\n      often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do\\r\\n      not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was\\r\\n      a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her,\\r\\n      that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before\\r\\n      we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her\\r\\n      too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty\\r\\n      they were.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There\\r\\n      has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder\\r\\n      who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away\\r\\n      love!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said\\r\\n      Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what\\r\\n      is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\r\\n      inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\r\\n      entirely away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\r\\n      Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\r\\n      again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\r\\n      and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\r\\n      to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\r\\n      troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil\\r\\n      in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\r\\n      and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed\\r\\n      without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\r\\n      soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the\\r\\n      youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had\\r\\n      been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the\\r\\n      result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with\\r\\n      having promised on his first coming into the country to give a\\r\\n      ball at Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\r\\n      complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her\\r\\n      mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early\\r\\n      age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\r\\n      self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom\\r\\n      her uncle’s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended\\r\\n      her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore,\\r\\n      to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly\\r\\n      reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\\r\\n      shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to\\r\\n      this sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\r\\n      when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\r\\n      very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while\\r\\n      she is ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes—it would be much\\r\\n      better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\r\\n      Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given\\r\\n      _your_ ball,” she added, “I shall insist on their giving one\\r\\n      also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he\\r\\n      does not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth\\r\\n      returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’\\r\\n      behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the\\r\\n      latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in\\r\\n      their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley’s witticisms\\r\\n      on _fine eyes_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n\\r\\n      The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and\\r\\n      Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\\r\\n      invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\\r\\n      evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The\\r\\n      loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and\\r\\n      Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\\r\\n      letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to\\r\\n      his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\r\\n      Hurst was observing their game.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\r\\n      attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The\\r\\n      perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting,\\r\\n      or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter,\\r\\n      with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received,\\r\\n      formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her\\r\\n      opinion of each.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You write uncommonly fast.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course\\r\\n      of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think\\r\\n      them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to\\r\\n      yours.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have already told her so once, by your desire.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I\\r\\n      mend pens remarkably well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Thank you—but I always mend my own.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How can you contrive to write so even?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\\r\\n      the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\\r\\n      her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it\\r\\n      infinitely superior to Miss Grantley’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write\\r\\n      again? At present I have not room to do them justice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do\\r\\n      you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not\\r\\n      for me to determine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\\r\\n      with ease, cannot write ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her\\r\\n      brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too\\r\\n      much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My style of writing is very different from yours.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless\\r\\n      way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the\\r\\n      rest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by\\r\\n      which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my\\r\\n      correspondents.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm\\r\\n      reproof.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\\r\\n      humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\\r\\n      an indirect boast.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of\\r\\n      modesty?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\r\\n      writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity\\r\\n      of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\\r\\n      estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of\\r\\n      doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the\\r\\n      possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\r\\n      the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if\\r\\n      you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in\\r\\n      five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\\r\\n      compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in\\r\\n      a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone,\\r\\n      and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all\\r\\n      the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon\\r\\n      my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I\\r\\n      believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume\\r\\n      the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\\r\\n      the ladies.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\r\\n      you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite\\r\\n      as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you\\r\\n      were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had\\r\\n      better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would\\r\\n      probably not go—and, at another word, might stay a month.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown\\r\\n      him off now much more than he did himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting\\r\\n      what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\\r\\n      temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\\r\\n      gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\\r\\n      the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\\r\\n      denial, and ride off as fast as I could.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\\r\\n      intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must\\r\\n      speak for himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call\\r\\n      mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case,\\r\\n      however, to stand according to your representation, you must\\r\\n      remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire\\r\\n      his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely\\r\\n      desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of\\r\\n      its propriety.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “To yield readily—easily—to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no\\r\\n      merit with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\\r\\n      understanding of either.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence\\r\\n      of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would\\r\\n      often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for\\r\\n      arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking\\r\\n      of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as\\r\\n      well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we\\r\\n      discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general\\r\\n      and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them\\r\\n      is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great\\r\\n      moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with\\r\\n      the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\r\\n      arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which\\r\\n      is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\\r\\n      intimacy subsisting between the parties?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars,\\r\\n      not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will\\r\\n      have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\\r\\n      aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall\\r\\n      fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so\\r\\n      much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than\\r\\n      Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his\\r\\n      own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\\r\\n      nothing to do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\\r\\n      he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss\\r\\n      Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\\r\\n      expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an\\r\\n      argument, and want to silence this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and\\r\\n      Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\\r\\n      be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\\r\\n      Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved\\r\\n      with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request\\r\\n      that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and\\r\\n      more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\\r\\n      employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over\\r\\n      some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy’s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose\\r\\n      that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and\\r\\n      yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still\\r\\n      more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last, that she\\r\\n      drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and\\r\\n      reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other\\r\\n      person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him\\r\\n      too little to care for his approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\\r\\n      by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\\r\\n      near Elizabeth, said to her—\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\\r\\n      an opportunity of dancing a reel?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with\\r\\n      some surprise at her silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh!” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\\r\\n      determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say\\r\\n      ‘Yes,’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\\r\\n      but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and\\r\\n      cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have,\\r\\n      therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\\r\\n      dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed I do not dare.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\\r\\n      his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\\r\\n      in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\\r\\n      and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by\\r\\n      her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of\\r\\n      her connections, he should be in some danger.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\\r\\n      great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\\r\\n      some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\\r\\n      talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\\r\\n      such an alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the\\r\\n      shrubbery the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few\\r\\n      hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\\r\\n      of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the\\r\\n      younger girls of running after the officers. And, if I may mention so\\r\\n      delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\\r\\n      bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\\r\\n      possesses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be\\r\\n      placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your\\r\\n      great uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know,\\r\\n      only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you\\r\\n      must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to\\r\\n      those beautiful eyes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but\\r\\n      their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,\\r\\n      might be copied.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\\r\\n      Elizabeth herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in\\r\\n      some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away\\r\\n      without telling us that you were coming out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\\r\\n      to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt\\r\\n      their rudeness, and immediately said,—\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go\\r\\n      into the avenue.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\\r\\n      them, laughingly answered,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and\\r\\n      appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by\\r\\n      admitting a fourth. Good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the\\r\\n      hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so\\r\\n      much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\\r\\n      hours that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\r\\n      sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into\\r\\n      the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with\\r\\n      many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them\\r\\n      so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the\\r\\n      gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were\\r\\n      considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy,\\r\\n      relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance\\r\\n      with spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first\\r\\n      object; Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,\\r\\n      and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many\\r\\n      steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite\\r\\n      congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he\\r\\n      was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for\\r\\n      Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first\\r\\n      half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\r\\n      from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the\\r\\n      other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the\\r\\n      door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\r\\n      else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with\\r\\n      great delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\r\\n      card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence\\r\\n      that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found\\r\\n      even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one\\r\\n      intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the\\r\\n      subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to\\r\\n      do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\r\\n      Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,\\r\\n      principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings,\\r\\n      joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\\r\\n      Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own;\\r\\n      and she was perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at\\r\\n      his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he\\r\\n      merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite\\r\\n      exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which\\r\\n      she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she\\r\\n      gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an\\r\\n      evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment\\r\\n      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\r\\n      book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I\\r\\n      have not an excellent library.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her\\r\\n      book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\r\\n      amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\r\\n      Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a\\r\\n      dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on\\r\\n      it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much\\r\\n      mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be\\r\\n      rather a punishment than a pleasure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\\r\\n      chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a\\r\\n      settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup\\r\\n      enough, I shall send round my cards.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they\\r\\n      were carried on in a different manner; but there is something\\r\\n      insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It\\r\\n      would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\r\\n      dancing were made the order of the day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\r\\n      not be near so much like a ball.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and\\r\\n      walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked\\r\\n      well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly\\r\\n      studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one\\r\\n      effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and\\r\\n      take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing\\r\\n      after sitting so long in one attitude.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss\\r\\n      Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention\\r\\n      in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously\\r\\n      closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but\\r\\n      he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives\\r\\n      for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with\\r\\n      either of which motives his joining them would interfere. “What\\r\\n      could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\r\\n      meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand\\r\\n      him?\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be\\r\\n      severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to\\r\\n      ask nothing about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation\\r\\n      of his two motives.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he,\\r\\n      as soon as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this\\r\\n      method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s\\r\\n      confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you\\r\\n      are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage\\r\\n      in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and\\r\\n      if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the\\r\\n      fire.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\\r\\n      abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said\\r\\n      Elizabeth. “We can all plague and punish one another. Tease\\r\\n      him—laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to\\r\\n      be done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy\\r\\n      has not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and\\r\\n      presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to\\r\\n      laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by\\r\\n      attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug\\r\\n      himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\\r\\n      uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it\\r\\n      would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I\\r\\n      dearly love a laugh.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.\\r\\n      The wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their\\r\\n      actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object\\r\\n      in life is a joke.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Certainly,” replied Elizabeth—“there are such people, but I hope\\r\\n      I am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and\\r\\n      good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_\\r\\n      divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,\\r\\n      I suppose, are precisely what you are without.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the\\r\\n      study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a\\r\\n      strong understanding to ridicule.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Such as vanity and pride.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a\\r\\n      real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\\r\\n      regulation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss\\r\\n      Bingley; “and pray what is the result?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He\\r\\n      owns it himself without disguise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults\\r\\n      enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I\\r\\n      dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little\\r\\n      yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I\\r\\n      cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought,\\r\\n      nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed\\r\\n      about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be\\r\\n      called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable\\r\\n      resentment _is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your\\r\\n      fault well. I really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some\\r\\n      particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best\\r\\n      education can overcome.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to\\r\\n      misunderstand them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\r\\n      conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not\\r\\n      mind my waking Mr. Hurst?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\r\\n      opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not\\r\\n      sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too\\r\\n      much attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n\\r\\n      In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\\r\\n      wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage\\r\\n      might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till\\r\\n      the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane’s week,\\r\\n      could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her\\r\\n      answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the\\r\\n      carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that\\r\\n      if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she\\r\\n      could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however,\\r\\n      Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she much expect it\\r\\n      would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered\\r\\n      as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled\\r\\n      that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning\\r\\n      should be mentioned, and the request made.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough\\r\\n      was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day\\r\\n      to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.\\r\\n      Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for\\r\\n      her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her\\r\\n      affection for the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to\\r\\n      go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it\\r\\n      would not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but\\r\\n      Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at\\r\\n      Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and\\r\\n      Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to\\r\\n      himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no\\r\\n      sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could\\r\\n      elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible\\r\\n      that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the\\r\\n      last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.\\r\\n      Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through\\r\\n      the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by\\r\\n      themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to\\r\\n      his book, and would not even look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to\\r\\n      almost all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth\\r\\n      increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for\\r\\n      Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the\\r\\n      pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn\\r\\n      or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook\\r\\n      hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in\\r\\n      the liveliest of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to\\r\\n      give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold\\r\\n      again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions\\r\\n      of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their\\r\\n      importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when\\r\\n      they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and\\r\\n      almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and\\r\\n      human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new\\r\\n      observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and\\r\\n      Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been\\r\\n      done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding\\r\\n      Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their\\r\\n      uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been\\r\\n      hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\r\\n      breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner\\r\\n      to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family\\r\\n      party.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am\\r\\n      sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope\\r\\n      _my_ dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often\\r\\n      sees such at home.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\\r\\n      to see Mr. Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a\\r\\n      bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I\\r\\n      must speak to Hill this moment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom\\r\\n      I never saw in the whole course of my life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\\r\\n      being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\\r\\n      once.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\r\\n      explained:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\\r\\n      ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\\r\\n      requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins,\\r\\n      who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon\\r\\n      as he pleases.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that\\r\\n      mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is\\r\\n      the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be\\r\\n      entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had\\r\\n      been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other\\r\\n      about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an\\r\\n      entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a\\r\\n      subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and\\r\\n      she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an\\r\\n      estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man\\r\\n      whom nobody cared anything about.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and\\r\\n      nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\\r\\n      Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\\r\\n      be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very\\r\\n      impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.\\r\\n      I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling\\r\\n      with you, as his father did before him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\\r\\n      that head, as you will hear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15_th October_.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Dear Sir,—\\r\\n      “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\\r\\n      honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have\\r\\n      had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal\\r\\n      the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,\\r\\n      fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to\\r\\n      be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him\\r\\n      to be at variance.—‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’—My mind, however, is now\\r\\n      made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter,\\r\\n      I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage\\r\\n      of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir\\r\\n      Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to\\r\\n      the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest\\r\\n      endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\\r\\n      ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies\\r\\n      which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,\\r\\n      moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing\\r\\n      of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on\\r\\n      these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are\\r\\n      highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in\\r\\n      the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\\r\\n      side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I\\r\\n      cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring\\r\\n      your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as\\r\\n      well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible\\r\\n      amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to\\r\\n      receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of\\r\\n      waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four\\r\\n      o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the\\r\\n      Saturday se’ennight following, which I can do without any\\r\\n      inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my\\r\\n      occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other\\r\\n      clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear\\r\\n      sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your\\r\\n      well-wisher and friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “WILLIAM COLLINS”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\\r\\n      gentleman,” said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He\\r\\n      seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my\\r\\n      word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\\r\\n      especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him\\r\\n      come to us again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\\r\\n      and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the\\r\\n      person to discourage him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can\\r\\n      mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\\r\\n      certainly to his credit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\\r\\n      Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\\r\\n      and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him\\r\\n      out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can\\r\\n      he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot\\r\\n      suppose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man,\\r\\n      sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him\\r\\n      quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and\\r\\n      self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am\\r\\n      impatient to see him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem\\r\\n      defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\\r\\n      new, yet I think it is well expressed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in\\r\\n      any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their\\r\\n      cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks\\r\\n      since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any\\r\\n      other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done\\r\\n      away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with\\r\\n      a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\r\\n      politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little;\\r\\n      but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed\\r\\n      neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent\\r\\n      himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\\r\\n      five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners\\r\\n      were very formal. He had not been long seated before he\\r\\n      complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters;\\r\\n      said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance\\r\\n      fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\\r\\n      doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.\\r\\n      This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers;\\r\\n      but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most\\r\\n      readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\\r\\n      may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are\\r\\n      settled so oddly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,\\r\\n      you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for\\r\\n      such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no\\r\\n      knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\\r\\n      and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\\r\\n      appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young\\r\\n      ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not\\r\\n      say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted—”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\\r\\n      on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s\\r\\n      admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture,\\r\\n      were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything\\r\\n      would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying\\r\\n      supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The\\r\\n      dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know\\r\\n      to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was\\r\\n      owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him\\r\\n      with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\\r\\n      cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He\\r\\n      begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she\\r\\n      declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to\\r\\n      apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n      During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the\\r\\n      servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some\\r\\n      conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\\r\\n      which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very\\r\\n      fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s attention\\r\\n      to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very\\r\\n      remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins\\r\\n      was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than\\r\\n      usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he\\r\\n      protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour\\r\\n      in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had\\r\\n      himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously\\r\\n      pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already\\r\\n      had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him\\r\\n      twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday\\r\\n      before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady\\r\\n      Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had\\r\\n      never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken\\r\\n      to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the\\r\\n      smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\r\\n      neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a\\r\\n      week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to\\r\\n      advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with\\r\\n      discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble\\r\\n      parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\r\\n      he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\\r\\n      herself—some shelves in the closet up stairs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      “and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that\\r\\n      great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near\\r\\n      you, sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by\\r\\n      a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship’s residence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\r\\n      extensive property.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off\\r\\n      than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she\\r\\n      handsome?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself\\r\\n      says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far\\r\\n      superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in\\r\\n      her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\r\\n      She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has\\r\\n      prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments\\r\\n      which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by\\r\\n      the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides\\r\\n      with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to\\r\\n      drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the\\r\\n      ladies at court.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\\r\\n      town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has\\r\\n      deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her\\r\\n      ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I\\r\\n      am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate\\r\\n      compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more\\r\\n      than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter\\r\\n      seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank,\\r\\n      instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These\\r\\n      are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it\\r\\n      is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound\\r\\n      to pay.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for\\r\\n      you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May\\r\\n      I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse\\r\\n      of the moment, or are the result of previous study?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though\\r\\n      I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such\\r\\n      little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary\\r\\n      occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as\\r\\n      possible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as\\r\\n      absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest\\r\\n      enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute\\r\\n      composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at\\r\\n      Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet\\r\\n      was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when\\r\\n      tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr.\\r\\n      Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on\\r\\n      beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a\\r\\n      circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\r\\n      protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and\\r\\n      Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some\\r\\n      deliberation he chose Fordyce’s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened\\r\\n      the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity,\\r\\n      read three pages, she interrupted him with:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\\r\\n      Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt\\r\\n      told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow\\r\\n      to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from\\r\\n      town.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but\\r\\n      Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\\r\\n      books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their\\r\\n      benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be\\r\\n      nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no\\r\\n      longer importune my young cousin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist\\r\\n      at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that\\r\\n      he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling\\r\\n      amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly\\r\\n      for Lydia’s interruption, and promised that it should not occur\\r\\n      again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after\\r\\n      assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and\\r\\n      should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself\\r\\n      at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature\\r\\n      had been but little assisted by education or society; the\\r\\n      greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of\\r\\n      an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one\\r\\n      of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms,\\r\\n      without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in\\r\\n      which his father had brought him up had given him originally\\r\\n      great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted\\r\\n      by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the\\r\\n      consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A\\r\\n      fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\r\\n      when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\\r\\n      felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his\\r\\n      patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his\\r\\n      authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him\\r\\n      altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance\\r\\n      and humility.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended\\r\\n      to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn\\r\\n      family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the\\r\\n      daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were\\r\\n      represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of\\r\\n      atonement—for inheriting their father’s estate; and he thought it\\r\\n      an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and\\r\\n      excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.\\r\\n\\r\\n      His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face\\r\\n      confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of\\r\\n      what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was\\r\\n      his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an\\r\\n      alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his\\r\\n      parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his\\r\\n      hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn,\\r\\n      produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\r\\n      encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.\\r\\n      “As to her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to\\r\\n      say—she could not positively answer—but she did not _know_ of any\\r\\n      prepossession; her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention—she\\r\\n      felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon\\r\\n      engaged.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was\\r\\n      soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\\r\\n      Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded\\r\\n      her of course.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might\\r\\n      soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not\\r\\n      bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every\\r\\n      sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to\\r\\n      attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious\\r\\n      to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither\\r\\n      Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would\\r\\n      continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the\\r\\n      collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little\\r\\n      cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings\\r\\n      discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\r\\n      always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as\\r\\n      he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other\\r\\n      room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\\r\\n      civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to\\r\\n      join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact\\r\\n      much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely\\r\\n      pleased to close his large book, and go.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\r\\n      cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The\\r\\n      attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by\\r\\n      _him_. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in\\r\\n      quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet\\r\\n      indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall\\r\\n      them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\\r\\n      whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike\\r\\n      appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the\\r\\n      way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return\\r\\n      from London Lydia came to enquire, and he bowed as they passed.\\r\\n      All were struck with the stranger’s air, all wondered who he\\r\\n      could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find\\r\\n      out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting\\r\\n      something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained\\r\\n      the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached\\r\\n      the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\\r\\n      permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned\\r\\n      with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had\\r\\n      accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it\\r\\n      should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him\\r\\n      completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he\\r\\n      had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good\\r\\n      figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed\\r\\n      up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness\\r\\n      at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole\\r\\n      party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\\r\\n      when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley\\r\\n      were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of\\r\\n      the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\\r\\n      began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,\\r\\n      and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on\\r\\n      his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to\\r\\n      fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by\\r\\n      the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the\\r\\n      countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all\\r\\n      astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\\r\\n      one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few\\r\\n      moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\\r\\n      deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was\\r\\n      impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have\\r\\n      noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the\\r\\n      door of Mr. Phillip’s house, and then made their bows, in spite\\r\\n      of Miss Lydia’s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and\\r\\n      even in spite of Mrs. Phillips’s throwing up the parlour window\\r\\n      and loudly seconding the invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two\\r\\n      eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and\\r\\n      she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return\\r\\n      home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she\\r\\n      should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see\\r\\n      Mr. Jones’s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they\\r\\n      were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the\\r\\n      Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\\r\\n      towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received\\r\\n      him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much\\r\\n      more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\\r\\n      acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering\\r\\n      himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the\\r\\n      young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was\\r\\n      quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her\\r\\n      contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by\\r\\n      exclamations and enquiries about the other; of whom, however, she\\r\\n      could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny\\r\\n      had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\r\\n      lieutenant’s commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him\\r\\n      the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and\\r\\n      had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have\\r\\n      continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now\\r\\n      except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the\\r\\n      stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of\\r\\n      them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their\\r\\n      aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give\\r\\n      him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come\\r\\n      in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested\\r\\n      that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\r\\n      tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect\\r\\n      of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual\\r\\n      good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the\\r\\n      room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were\\r\\n      perfectly needless.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen\\r\\n      pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have\\r\\n      defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong,\\r\\n      she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by\\r\\n      admiring Mrs. Phillips’s manners and politeness. He protested\\r\\n      that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a\\r\\n      more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the\\r\\n      utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her\\r\\n      invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her\\r\\n      before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\r\\n      connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\\r\\n      attention in the whole course of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n      As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with\\r\\n      their aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\\r\\n      steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at\\r\\n      a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\\r\\n      hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had\\r\\n      accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When this information was given, and they had all taken their\\r\\n      seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\\r\\n      and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\\r\\n      apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself\\r\\n      in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison\\r\\n      that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its\\r\\n      proprietor—when she had listened to the description of only one\\r\\n      of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that the\\r\\n      chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\r\\n      the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a\\r\\n      comparison with the housekeeper’s room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\\r\\n      mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\\r\\n      abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\\r\\n      employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his\\r\\n      consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving\\r\\n      to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To\\r\\n      the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had\\r\\n      nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their\\r\\n      own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the\\r\\n      interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last,\\r\\n      however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked\\r\\n      into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing\\r\\n      him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree\\r\\n      of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in\\r\\n      general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of\\r\\n      them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond\\r\\n      them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were\\r\\n      superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing\\r\\n      port wine, who followed them into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female\\r\\n      eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he\\r\\n      finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he\\r\\n      immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its\\r\\n      being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest,\\r\\n      most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill\\r\\n      of the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\\r\\n      the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\\r\\n      the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\\r\\n      intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\\r\\n      watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\r\\n      When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\\r\\n      obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be\\r\\n      glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life—” Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for\\r\\n      his reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\r\\n      received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first\\r\\n      there seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she\\r\\n      was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond\\r\\n      of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\\r\\n      game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\\r\\n      have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common\\r\\n      demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk\\r\\n      to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what\\r\\n      she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told—the\\r\\n      history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\\r\\n      mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\r\\n      relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He enquired how\\r\\n      far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her\\r\\n      answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been\\r\\n      staying there.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\\r\\n      subject drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in\\r\\n      Derbyshire, I understand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A\\r\\n      clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a\\r\\n      person more capable of giving you certain information on that\\r\\n      head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a\\r\\n      particular manner from my infancy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not but look surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\\r\\n      after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\\r\\n      meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I\\r\\n      have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him\\r\\n      very disagreeable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his\\r\\n      being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I\\r\\n      have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is\\r\\n      impossible for _me_ to be impartial. But I believe your opinion\\r\\n      of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not\\r\\n      express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your\\r\\n      own family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house\\r\\n      in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked\\r\\n      in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will\\r\\n      not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\\r\\n      interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated\\r\\n      beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often\\r\\n      happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or\\r\\n      frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as\\r\\n      he chooses to be seen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\n      ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\\r\\n      “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away\\r\\n      when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the\\r\\n      ——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! no—it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If\\r\\n      _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on\\r\\n      friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\\r\\n      have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim\\r\\n      before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\\r\\n      painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet,\\r\\n      the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\\r\\n      and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\\r\\n      with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\r\\n      thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\n      scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\n      everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\\r\\n      disgracing the memory of his father.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and\\r\\n      listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented\\r\\n      further enquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\r\\n      neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\\r\\n      that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\\r\\n      very intelligible gallantry.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he\\r\\n      added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I\\r\\n      knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend\\r\\n      Denny tempted me further by his account of their present\\r\\n      quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\\r\\n      acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is\\r\\n      necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\\r\\n      will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society. A\\r\\n      military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\\r\\n      have now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my\\r\\n      profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this\\r\\n      time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\\r\\n      pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of\\r\\n      the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively\\r\\n      attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to\\r\\n      provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the\\r\\n      living fell, it was given elsewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How\\r\\n      could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal\\r\\n      redress?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\\r\\n      as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have\\r\\n      doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to\\r\\n      treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert\\r\\n      that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,\\r\\n      imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the\\r\\n      living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to\\r\\n      hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less\\r\\n      certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\r\\n      anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper,\\r\\n      and I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\\r\\n      freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are\\r\\n      very different sort of men, and that he hates me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Some time or other he _will_ be—but it shall not be by _me_.\\r\\n      Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\\r\\n      handsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?\\r\\n      What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot\\r\\n      but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his\\r\\n      father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very\\r\\n      early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of\\r\\n      competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was\\r\\n      often given me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never\\r\\n      liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed\\r\\n      him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not\\r\\n      suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such\\r\\n      injustice, such inhumanity as this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\\r\\n      remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\\r\\n      implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\\r\\n      temper. His disposition must be dreadful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_\\r\\n      can hardly be just to him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\\r\\n      “To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite\\r\\n      of his father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like\\r\\n      _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\\r\\n      amiable”—but she contented herself with, “and one, too, who had\\r\\n      probably been his companion from childhood, connected together,\\r\\n      as I think you said, in the closest manner!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\\r\\n      greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\\r\\n      same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\\r\\n      parental care. _My_ father began life in the profession which\\r\\n      your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but he\\r\\n      gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted\\r\\n      all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most\\r\\n      highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential\\r\\n      friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the\\r\\n      greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence, and\\r\\n      when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\r\\n      voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he\\r\\n      felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his\\r\\n      affection to myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that\\r\\n      the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If\\r\\n      from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to\\r\\n      be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions\\r\\n      may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\r\\n      It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\\r\\n      feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\\r\\n      to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give\\r\\n      his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants,\\r\\n      and relieve the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride—for he is\\r\\n      very proud of what his father was—have done this. Not to appear\\r\\n      to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities,\\r\\n      or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful\\r\\n      motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_\\r\\n      brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian\\r\\n      of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the\\r\\n      most attentive and best of brothers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me\\r\\n      pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her\\r\\n      brother—very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and\\r\\n      pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and\\r\\n      hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a\\r\\n      handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand,\\r\\n      highly accomplished. Since her father’s death, her home has been\\r\\n      London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\r\\n      education.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\\r\\n      could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\\r\\n      truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they\\r\\n      suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know\\r\\n      what Mr. Darcy is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does\\r\\n      not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he\\r\\n      thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals\\r\\n      in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\\r\\n      less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\\r\\n      he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\\r\\n      perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered\\r\\n      round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between\\r\\n      his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual enquiries as to\\r\\n      his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great;\\r\\n      he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express\\r\\n      her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity\\r\\n      that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the\\r\\n      money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make\\r\\n      herself uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down\\r\\n      to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things,\\r\\n      and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five\\r\\n      shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not\\r\\n      say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am\\r\\n      removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr.\\r\\n      Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\\r\\n      whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\\r\\n      family of de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given\\r\\n      him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced\\r\\n      to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne\\r\\n      Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\\r\\n      connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\r\\n      yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\\r\\n      and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\\r\\n      estates.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\\r\\n      Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\\r\\n      useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself,\\r\\n      if he were already self-destined for another.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine\\r\\n      and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\\r\\n      of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that\\r\\n      in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant,\\r\\n      conceited woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I\\r\\n      have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I\\r\\n      never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\\r\\n      insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and\\r\\n      clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\\r\\n      from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\\r\\n      and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that\\r\\n      everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the\\r\\n      first class.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of\\r\\n      it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction\\r\\n      till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies\\r\\n      their share of Mr. Wickham’s attentions. There could be no\\r\\n      conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but\\r\\n      his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was\\r\\n      said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went\\r\\n      away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but\\r\\n      there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went,\\r\\n      for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked\\r\\n      incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\r\\n      fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of\\r\\n      Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least\\r\\n      regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper,\\r\\n      and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to\\r\\n      say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at\\r\\n      Longbourn House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and\\r\\n      concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so\\r\\n      unworthy of Mr. Bingley’s regard; and yet, it was not in her\\r\\n      nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable\\r\\n      appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having endured such\\r\\n      unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and\\r\\n      nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them\\r\\n      both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account\\r\\n      of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some\\r\\n      way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people\\r\\n      have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short,\\r\\n      impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which\\r\\n      may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to\\r\\n      say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been\\r\\n      concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be\\r\\n      obliged to think ill of somebody.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\r\\n      opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful\\r\\n      light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite\\r\\n      in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide\\r\\n      for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had\\r\\n      any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most\\r\\n      intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on,\\r\\n      than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as\\r\\n      he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without\\r\\n      ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides,\\r\\n      there was truth in his looks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what\\r\\n      to think.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Jane could think with certainty on only one point—that Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer\\r\\n      when the affair became public.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\r\\n      conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom\\r\\n      they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give\\r\\n      their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at\\r\\n      Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two\\r\\n      ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it\\r\\n      an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been\\r\\n      doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the\\r\\n      family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much\\r\\n      as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\\r\\n      the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats\\r\\n      with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\\r\\n      hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to\\r\\n      every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as\\r\\n      given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly\\r\\n      flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,\\r\\n      instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy\\r\\n      evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of\\r\\n      their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a\\r\\n      great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of\\r\\n      everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour. The happiness\\r\\n      anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\r\\n      event, or any particular person, for though they each, like\\r\\n      Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he\\r\\n      was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a\\r\\n      ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her\\r\\n      family that she had no disinclination for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is\\r\\n      enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening\\r\\n      engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself\\r\\n      one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement\\r\\n      as desirable for everybody.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though\\r\\n      she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could\\r\\n      not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s\\r\\n      invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to\\r\\n      join in the evening’s amusement; and she was rather surprised to\\r\\n      find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and\\r\\n      was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,\\r\\n      or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a\\r\\n      ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to\\r\\n      respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far\\r\\n      from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\\r\\n      honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of\\r\\n      the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,\\r\\n      Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference\\r\\n      which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause,\\r\\n      and not to any disrespect for her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully\\r\\n      proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and\\r\\n      to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse\\r\\n      timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness\\r\\n      and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr.\\r\\n      Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.\\r\\n      She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea\\r\\n      it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that\\r\\n      _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being\\r\\n      mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\r\\n      quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible\\r\\n      visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed\\r\\n      his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent\\r\\n      attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more\\r\\n      astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms,\\r\\n      it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the\\r\\n      probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_.\\r\\n      Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well\\r\\n      aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any\\r\\n      reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did,\\r\\n      it was useless to quarrel about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk\\r\\n      of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable\\r\\n      state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the\\r\\n      day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented\\r\\n      their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news\\r\\n      could be sought after—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were\\r\\n      got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her\\r\\n      patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of\\r\\n      her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance\\r\\n      on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\\r\\n      Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n      Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and\\r\\n      looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats\\r\\n      there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred\\r\\n      to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any\\r\\n      of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed\\r\\n      her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in\\r\\n      the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained\\r\\n      unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might\\r\\n      be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\\r\\n      dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy’s\\r\\n      pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though\\r\\n      this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence\\r\\n      was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly\\r\\n      applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to\\r\\n      town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;\\r\\n      adding, with a significant smile, “I do not imagine his business\\r\\n      would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to\\r\\n      avoid a certain gentleman here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\\r\\n      caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\\r\\n      less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise\\r\\n      had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former\\r\\n      was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could\\r\\n      hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries\\r\\n      which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,\\r\\n      forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was\\r\\n      resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned\\r\\n      away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly\\r\\n      surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality\\r\\n      provoked her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\\r\\n      prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not\\r\\n      dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to\\r\\n      Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon\\r\\n      able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her\\r\\n      cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first\\r\\n      two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\r\\n      dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\r\\n      apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without\\r\\n      being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\\r\\n      disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment\\r\\n      of her release from him was ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of\\r\\n      talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\r\\n      When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and\\r\\n      was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly\\r\\n      addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his\\r\\n      application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she\\r\\n      accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left\\r\\n      to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to\\r\\n      console her:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\r\\n      To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not\\r\\n      wish me such an evil.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to\\r\\n      claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a\\r\\n      whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham\\r\\n      to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his\\r\\n      consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the\\r\\n      set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being\\r\\n      allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her\\r\\n      neighbours’ looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They\\r\\n      stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\r\\n      imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances,\\r\\n      and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying\\r\\n      that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige\\r\\n      him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He\\r\\n      replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she\\r\\n      addressed him a second time with:—“It is _your_ turn to say\\r\\n      something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_\\r\\n      ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the\\r\\n      number of couples.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\\r\\n      should be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by\\r\\n      I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public\\r\\n      ones. But _now_ we may be silent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd\\r\\n      to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the\\r\\n      advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as\\r\\n      that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\\r\\n      you imagine that you are gratifying mine?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\\r\\n      similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\\r\\n      taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\r\\n      something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\r\\n      posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am\\r\\n      sure,” said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend\\r\\n      to say. _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I must not decide on my own performance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\\r\\n      down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not\\r\\n      very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and,\\r\\n      unable to resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there\\r\\n      the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread\\r\\n      his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though\\r\\n      blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length\\r\\n      Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is\\r\\n      blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_\\r\\n      friends—whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is\\r\\n      less certain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied\\r\\n      Elizabeth with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to\\r\\n      suffer from all his life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the\\r\\n      subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to\\r\\n      them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the\\r\\n      room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of\\r\\n      superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his\\r\\n      partner.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\\r\\n      superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong\\r\\n      to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair\\r\\n      partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this\\r\\n      pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable\\r\\n      event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall\\r\\n      take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank\\r\\n      me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young\\r\\n      lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\\r\\n      Sir William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him\\r\\n      forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious\\r\\n      expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\r\\n      Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,\\r\\n      and said, “Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we\\r\\n      were talking of.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not\\r\\n      have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for\\r\\n      themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without\\r\\n      success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the\\r\\n      same feelings.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at\\r\\n      least be no want of subject. We may compare our different\\r\\n      opinions.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full\\r\\n      of something else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes—does it?” said\\r\\n      he, with a look of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for\\r\\n      her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\\r\\n      afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember\\r\\n      hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,\\r\\n      that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very\\r\\n      cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created?_”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am,” said he, with a firm voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I hope not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their\\r\\n      opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “May I ask to what these questions tend?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she,\\r\\n      endeavouring to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it\\r\\n      out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And what is your success?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such\\r\\n      different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may\\r\\n      vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,\\r\\n      that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,\\r\\n      as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no\\r\\n      credit on either.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\r\\n      opportunity.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly\\r\\n      replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and\\r\\n      parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to\\r\\n      an equal degree, for in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably\\r\\n      powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and\\r\\n      directed all his anger against another.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her,\\r\\n      and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\\r\\n      Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking\\r\\n      me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite\\r\\n      forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was\\r\\n      the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me\\r\\n      recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\\r\\n      confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s using him\\r\\n      ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always\\r\\n      been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the\\r\\n      particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\\r\\n      least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\\r\\n      mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not\\r\\n      well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\r\\n      was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\\r\\n      way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\\r\\n      indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\\r\\n      Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but\\r\\n      really, considering his descent, one could not expect much\\r\\n      better.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\r\\n      same,” said Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him\\r\\n      of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward,\\r\\n      and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\\r\\n      sneer. “Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much\\r\\n      mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as\\r\\n      this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\\r\\n      malice of Mr. Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had\\r\\n      undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane\\r\\n      met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such\\r\\n      happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\r\\n      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth\\r\\n      instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\\r\\n      Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else,\\r\\n      gave way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for\\r\\n      happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling\\r\\n      than her sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But\\r\\n      perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any\\r\\n      third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\n      satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\r\\n      his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which\\r\\n      have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the\\r\\n      good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is\\r\\n      perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less\\r\\n      attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to\\r\\n      say by his account as well as his sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no\\r\\n      means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very\\r\\n      imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\r\\n      satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\\r\\n      heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it\\r\\n      was left to him _conditionally_ only.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth\\r\\n      warmly; “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances\\r\\n      only. Mr. Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I\\r\\n      dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the\\r\\n      story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall\\r\\n      venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\\r\\n      and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth\\r\\n      listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which\\r\\n      Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley’s regard, and said all in her\\r\\n      power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose\\r\\n      enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had\\r\\n      scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told\\r\\n      her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\\r\\n      to make a most important discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there\\r\\n      is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to\\r\\n      overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who\\r\\n      does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de\\r\\n      Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these\\r\\n      sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with,\\r\\n      perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I\\r\\n      am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay\\r\\n      my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will\\r\\n      excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the\\r\\n      connection must plead my apology.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it\\r\\n      earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will\\r\\n      be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well\\r\\n      yesterday se’nnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring\\r\\n      him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without\\r\\n      introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment\\r\\n      to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should\\r\\n      be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong\\r\\n      to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the\\r\\n      acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air\\r\\n      of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,\\r\\n      replied thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world\\r\\n      in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of\\r\\n      your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a\\r\\n      wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst\\r\\n      the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me\\r\\n      leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in\\r\\n      point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided\\r\\n      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time\\r\\n      maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of\\r\\n      my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I\\r\\n      look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\\r\\n      your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\\r\\n      guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted\\r\\n      by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a\\r\\n      young lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to\\r\\n      attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly\\r\\n      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very\\r\\n      evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and\\r\\n      though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it\\r\\n      all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\\r\\n      “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see\\r\\n      him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\r\\n      unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\r\\n      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\\r\\n      of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\\r\\n      slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied\\r\\n      with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\\r\\n      attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid\\r\\n      me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady\\r\\n      Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a\\r\\n      favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon\\r\\n      the whole, I am much pleased with him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she\\r\\n      turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her\\r\\n      observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\\r\\n      Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\\r\\n      felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\\r\\n      felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\\r\\n      like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw\\r\\n      were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\\r\\n      her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,\\r\\n      therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\\r\\n      placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to\\r\\n      find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)\\r\\n      freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane\\r\\n      would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating\\r\\n      subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while\\r\\n      enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a\\r\\n      charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from\\r\\n      them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was\\r\\n      such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,\\r\\n      and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\\r\\n      she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her\\r\\n      younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them\\r\\n      in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at\\r\\n      her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to\\r\\n      the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go\\r\\n      into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this\\r\\n      circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it\\r\\n      is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to\\r\\n      find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\\r\\n      concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be\\r\\n      equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing\\r\\n      there was no chance of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\\r\\n      mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a\\r\\n      less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she\\r\\n      could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy,\\r\\n      who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being\\r\\n      nonsensical.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I\\r\\n      am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged\\r\\n      to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be\\r\\n      for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to\\r\\n      his friend by so doing!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her\\r\\n      mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\r\\n      Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She\\r\\n      could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though\\r\\n      every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was\\r\\n      not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his\\r\\n      attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face\\r\\n      changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\r\\n      steady gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\\r\\n      Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights\\r\\n      which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts\\r\\n      of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not\\r\\n      long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,\\r\\n      singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing\\r\\n      Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\\r\\n      company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she\\r\\n      endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;\\r\\n      Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting\\r\\n      was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes\\r\\n      were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched\\r\\n      her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which\\r\\n      was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,\\r\\n      amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she\\r\\n      might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of\\r\\n      half a minute began another. Mary’s powers were by no means\\r\\n      fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner\\r\\n      affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see\\r\\n      how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.\\r\\n      She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of\\r\\n      derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\r\\n      imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\r\\n      interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the\\r\\n      hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\\r\\n      “That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long\\r\\n      enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;\\r\\n      and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech,\\r\\n      was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were\\r\\n      now applied to.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to\\r\\n      sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the\\r\\n      company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent\\r\\n      diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a\\r\\n      clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be\\r\\n      justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there\\r\\n      are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a\\r\\n      parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an\\r\\n      agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\r\\n      offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the\\r\\n      time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and\\r\\n      the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be\\r\\n      excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not\\r\\n      think it of light importance that he should have attentive and\\r\\n      conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those\\r\\n      to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;\\r\\n      nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of\\r\\n      testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\\r\\n      family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,\\r\\n      which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.\\r\\n      Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\\r\\n      Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins\\r\\n      for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to\\r\\n      Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young\\r\\n      man.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\\r\\n      to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it\\r\\n      would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more\\r\\n      spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley\\r\\n      and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his\\r\\n      notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much\\r\\n      distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his\\r\\n      two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an\\r\\n      opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she\\r\\n      could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman,\\r\\n      or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was\\r\\n      teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her\\r\\n      side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him\\r\\n      again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did\\r\\n      she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to\\r\\n      introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that\\r\\n      as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief\\r\\n      object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and\\r\\n      that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\\r\\n      the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She\\r\\n      owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often\\r\\n      joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s\\r\\n      conversation to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further\\r\\n      notice; though often standing within a very short distance of\\r\\n      her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She\\r\\n      felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\\r\\n      and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their\\r\\n      carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,\\r\\n      which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by\\r\\n      some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened\\r\\n      their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently\\r\\n      impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every\\r\\n      attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\\r\\n      languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by\\r\\n      the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment,\\r\\n      and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their\\r\\n      behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet,\\r\\n      in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane\\r\\n      were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and\\r\\n      talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\r\\n      silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was\\r\\n      too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation\\r\\n      of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\\r\\n      pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at\\r\\n      Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to\\r\\n      assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner\\r\\n      with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal\\r\\n      invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily\\r\\n      engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,\\r\\n      after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the\\r\\n      next day for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under\\r\\n      the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary\\r\\n      preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,\\r\\n      she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in\\r\\n      the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter\\r\\n      married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and\\r\\n      with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the\\r\\n      least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the\\r\\n      match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was\\r\\n      eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n      The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made\\r\\n      his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of\\r\\n      time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following\\r\\n      Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it\\r\\n      distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a\\r\\n      very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed\\r\\n      a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after\\r\\n      breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter\\r\\n      Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience\\r\\n      with her in the course of this morning?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am\\r\\n      sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no\\r\\n      objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.” And, gathering her\\r\\n      work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must\\r\\n      excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not\\r\\n      hear. I am going away myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.”\\r\\n      And upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed\\r\\n      looks, about to escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your\\r\\n      staying and hearing Mr. Collins.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment’s\\r\\n      consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to\\r\\n      get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down\\r\\n      again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings\\r\\n      which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins\\r\\n      began.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far\\r\\n      from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\\r\\n      perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had\\r\\n      there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to\\r\\n      assure you, that I have your respected mother’s permission for\\r\\n      this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,\\r\\n      however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\r\\n      attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as\\r\\n      I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my\\r\\n      future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\r\\n      subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons\\r\\n      for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with\\r\\n      the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run\\r\\n      away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that\\r\\n      she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to\\r\\n      stop him further, and he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right\\r\\n      thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to\\r\\n      set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am\\r\\n      convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and\\r\\n      thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it\\r\\n      is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble\\r\\n      lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she\\r\\n      condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\r\\n      subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\r\\n      Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\r\\n      arranging Miss de Bourgh’s footstool, that she said, ‘Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose\\r\\n      properly, choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_,\\r\\n      let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high,\\r\\n      but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice.\\r\\n      Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and\\r\\n      I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair\\r\\n      cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady\\r\\n      Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my\\r\\n      power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can\\r\\n      describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable\\r\\n      to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\\r\\n      which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\r\\n      intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my\\r\\n      views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own\\r\\n      neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable\\r\\n      young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit\\r\\n      this estate after the death of your honoured father (who,\\r\\n      however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself\\r\\n      without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\r\\n      the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the\\r\\n      melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already\\r\\n      said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my\\r\\n      fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your\\r\\n      esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the\\r\\n      most animated language of the violence of my affection. To\\r\\n      fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of\\r\\n      that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could\\r\\n      not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four\\r\\n      per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother’s\\r\\n      decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\r\\n      therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure\\r\\n      yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when\\r\\n      we are married.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made\\r\\n      no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my\\r\\n      thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible\\r\\n      of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to\\r\\n      do otherwise than to decline them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\\r\\n      of the hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the\\r\\n      addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he\\r\\n      first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is\\r\\n      repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no\\r\\n      means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to\\r\\n      lead you to the altar ere long.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather\\r\\n      extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am\\r\\n      not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)\\r\\n      who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of\\r\\n      being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\r\\n      You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the\\r\\n      last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your\\r\\n      friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find\\r\\n      me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr.\\r\\n      Collins very gravely—“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship\\r\\n      would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I\\r\\n      have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very\\r\\n      highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable\\r\\n      qualification.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\\r\\n      must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\\r\\n      of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and\\r\\n      by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being\\r\\n      otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the\\r\\n      delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take\\r\\n      possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any\\r\\n      self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as\\r\\n      finally settled.” And rising as she thus spoke, she would have\\r\\n      quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the\\r\\n      subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than\\r\\n      you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of\\r\\n      cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established\\r\\n      custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and\\r\\n      perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as\\r\\n      would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\r\\n      character.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you\\r\\n      puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to\\r\\n      you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my\\r\\n      refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that\\r\\n      your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My\\r\\n      reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to\\r\\n      me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the\\r\\n      establishment I can offer would be any other than highly\\r\\n      desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family\\r\\n      of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances\\r\\n      highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\n      consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is\\r\\n      by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be\\r\\n      made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all\\r\\n      likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable\\r\\n      qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not\\r\\n      serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it\\r\\n      to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the\\r\\n      usual practice of elegant females.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to\\r\\n      that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable\\r\\n      man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed\\r\\n      sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done\\r\\n      me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely\\r\\n      impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak\\r\\n      plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending\\r\\n      to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth\\r\\n      from her heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\\r\\n      gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the\\r\\n      express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals\\r\\n      will not fail of being acceptable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\\r\\n      make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew;\\r\\n      determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals\\r\\n      as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose\\r\\n      negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and\\r\\n      whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the\\r\\n      affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\n      successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\\r\\n      vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\\r\\n      Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the\\r\\n      staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated\\r\\n      both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their\\r\\n      nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these\\r\\n      felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate\\r\\n      the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he\\r\\n      trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal\\r\\n      which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\r\\n      from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her\\r\\n      character.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have\\r\\n      been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to\\r\\n      encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared\\r\\n      not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall\\r\\n      be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She\\r\\n      is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own\\r\\n      interest but I will _make_ her know it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but\\r\\n      if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she\\r\\n      would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\\r\\n      situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\\r\\n      state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\\r\\n      perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\\r\\n      because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\\r\\n      contribute much to my felicity.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\\r\\n      “Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything\\r\\n      else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go\\r\\n      directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with\\r\\n      her, I am sure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\\r\\n      her husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr.\\r\\n      Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You\\r\\n      must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\\r\\n      not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his\\r\\n      mind and not have _her_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\\r\\n      fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the\\r\\n      least altered by her communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she\\r\\n      had finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have\\r\\n      Lizzy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless\\r\\n      business.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon\\r\\n      her marrying him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\r\\n      library.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have\\r\\n      sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr.\\r\\n      Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth\\r\\n      replied that it was. “Very well—and this offer of marriage you\\r\\n      have refused?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon\\r\\n      your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, or I will never see her again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day\\r\\n      you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will\\r\\n      never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will\\r\\n      never see you again if you _do_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\\r\\n      beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\\r\\n      husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\\r\\n      disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised\\r\\n      me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to\\r\\n      request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my\\r\\n      understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.\\r\\n      I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\\r\\n      did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again\\r\\n      and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to\\r\\n      secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\\r\\n      mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\\r\\n      real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\\r\\n      her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination\\r\\n      never did.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\\r\\n      passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\\r\\n      motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\\r\\n      hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite\\r\\n      imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother’s\\r\\n      reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\r\\n\\r\\n      While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\\r\\n      spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\\r\\n      who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are\\r\\n      come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened\\r\\n      this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she\\r\\n      will not have him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\\r\\n      Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\\r\\n      entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she\\r\\n      likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\\r\\n      compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\\r\\n      comply with the wishes of all her family. “Pray do, my dear Miss\\r\\n      Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone, “for nobody is on my\\r\\n      side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels\\r\\n      for my poor nerves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as\\r\\n      unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were\\r\\n      at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss\\r\\n      Lizzy—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer\\r\\n      of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and\\r\\n      I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father\\r\\n      is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I\\r\\n      have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library,\\r\\n      you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will\\r\\n      find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to\\r\\n      undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in\\r\\n      talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous\\r\\n      complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can\\r\\n      tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not\\r\\n      complain are never pitied.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\r\\n      any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase\\r\\n      the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption\\r\\n      from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who\\r\\n      entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on\\r\\n      perceiving whom, she said to the girls, “Now, I do insist upon\\r\\n      it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr.\\r\\n      Collins have a little conversation together.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\\r\\n      followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\\r\\n      could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, whose enquiries after herself and all her family were\\r\\n      very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself\\r\\n      with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a\\r\\n      doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: “Oh!\\r\\n      Mr. Collins!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this\\r\\n      point. Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice\\r\\n      that marked his displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your\\r\\n      daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all;\\r\\n      the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\\r\\n      have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps\\r\\n      not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had\\r\\n      my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often\\r\\n      observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the\\r\\n      blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\r\\n      estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\\r\\n      disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my\\r\\n      pretensions to your daughter’s favour, without having paid\\r\\n      yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to\\r\\n      interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be\\r\\n      objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\\r\\n      daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to\\r\\n      error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My\\r\\n      object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\\r\\n      due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my\\r\\n      _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\\r\\n      apologise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n      The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end,\\r\\n      and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\n      necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish\\r\\n      allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_\\r\\n      feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or\\r\\n      dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner\\r\\n      and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\\r\\n      assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\\r\\n      were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\r\\n      civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all,\\r\\n      and especially to her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour or\\r\\n      ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry\\r\\n      pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his\\r\\n      visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.\\r\\n      He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant\\r\\n      to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the\\r\\n      Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and\\r\\n      attended them to their aunt’s where his regret and vexation, and\\r\\n      the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth,\\r\\n      however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his\\r\\n      absence _had_ been self-imposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not\\r\\n      meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with\\r\\n      him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear,\\r\\n      and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\\r\\n      full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they\\r\\n      civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer\\r\\n      walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he\\r\\n      particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double\\r\\n      advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and\\r\\n      it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her\\r\\n      father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet;\\r\\n      it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of\\r\\n      elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s\\r\\n      fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance\\r\\n      change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some\\r\\n      particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting\\r\\n      the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the\\r\\n      general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the\\r\\n      subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\\r\\n      sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from\\r\\n      Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained\\r\\n      their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me\\r\\n      a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time,\\r\\n      and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming\\r\\n      back again. You shall hear what she says.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the\\r\\n      information of their having just resolved to follow their brother\\r\\n      to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor\\r\\n      Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:\\r\\n      “I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we\\r\\n      will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\r\\n      delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\r\\n      lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\r\\n      unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To these\\r\\n      highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the\\r\\n      insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their\\r\\n      removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it\\r\\n      was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would\\r\\n      prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their\\r\\n      society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in\\r\\n      the enjoyment of his.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should\\r\\n      not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\r\\n      But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which\\r\\n      Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware,\\r\\n      and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends\\r\\n      will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley will not be detained in London by them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\r\\n      Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business\\r\\n      which took him to London might be concluded in three or four\\r\\n      days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time\\r\\n      convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry\\r\\n      to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither,\\r\\n      that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a\\r\\n      comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for\\r\\n      the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend,\\r\\n      had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I\\r\\n      despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may\\r\\n      abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and\\r\\n      that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling\\r\\n      the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more\\r\\n      this winter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\\r\\n      _should_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own\\r\\n      master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage\\r\\n      which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the\\r\\n      truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really\\r\\n      do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,\\r\\n      and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and\\r\\n      myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from\\r\\n      the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I\\r\\n      do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on\\r\\n      this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding\\r\\n      them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My\\r\\n      brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent\\r\\n      opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\\r\\n      relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a\\r\\n      sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call\\r\\n      Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all\\r\\n      these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to\\r\\n      prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of\\r\\n      an event which will secure the happiness of so many?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane\\r\\n      as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not\\r\\n      expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to\\r\\n      be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s\\r\\n      indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings\\r\\n      for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can\\r\\n      there be any other opinion on the subject?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear\\r\\n      it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Most willingly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her\\r\\n      brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\r\\n      She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries\\r\\n      to persuade you that he does not care about you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen\\r\\n      you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure,\\r\\n      cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as\\r\\n      much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her\\r\\n      wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or\\r\\n      grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss\\r\\n      Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been\\r\\n      _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a\\r\\n      second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare\\r\\n      say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\\r\\n      my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss\\r\\n      Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is\\r\\n      in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he\\r\\n      took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to\\r\\n      persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very\\r\\n      much in love with her friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\\r\\n      representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know\\r\\n      the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully\\r\\n      deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that\\r\\n      she is deceiving herself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea,\\r\\n      since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be\\r\\n      deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and\\r\\n      must fret no longer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\r\\n      accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to\\r\\n      marry elsewhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon\\r\\n      mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his\\r\\n      two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his\\r\\n      wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know\\r\\n      that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their\\r\\n      disapprobation, I could not hesitate.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot\\r\\n      consider your situation with much compassion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\r\\n      required. A thousand things may arise in six months!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the\\r\\n      utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of\\r\\n      Caroline’s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment\\r\\n      suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,\\r\\n      could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she\\r\\n      felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its\\r\\n      happy effect. Jane’s temper was not desponding, and she was\\r\\n      gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\\r\\n      sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\\r\\n      Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of\\r\\n      the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s\\r\\n      conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great\\r\\n      deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that\\r\\n      the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting\\r\\n      so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some\\r\\n      length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon\\r\\n      down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of\\r\\n      all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been\\r\\n      invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two\\r\\n      full courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again\\r\\n      during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen\\r\\n      to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.\\r\\n      “It keeps him in good humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged\\r\\n      to you than I can express.” Charlotte assured her friend of her\\r\\n      satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for\\r\\n      the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but\\r\\n      Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any\\r\\n      conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\r\\n      from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them\\r\\n      towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances\\r\\n      were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would\\r\\n      have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave\\r\\n      Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the\\r\\n      fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape\\r\\n      out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness,\\r\\n      and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was\\r\\n      anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction\\r\\n      that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture\\r\\n      his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till\\r\\n      its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\\r\\n      secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably\\r\\n      encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure\\r\\n      of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering\\r\\n      kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked\\r\\n      towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally\\r\\n      in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love\\r\\n      and eloquence awaited her there.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\\r\\n      everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;\\r\\n      and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name\\r\\n      the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such\\r\\n      a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no\\r\\n      inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with\\r\\n      which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any\\r\\n      charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss\\r\\n      Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested\\r\\n      desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment\\r\\n      were gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their\\r\\n      consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr.\\r\\n      Collins’s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for\\r\\n      their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his\\r\\n      prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas\\r\\n      began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter\\r\\n      had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was\\r\\n      likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion,\\r\\n      that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\r\\n      Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\\r\\n      his wife should make their appearance at St. James’s. The whole\\r\\n      family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The\\r\\n      younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner\\r\\n      than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\\r\\n      from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid.\\r\\n      Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her\\r\\n      point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in\\r\\n      general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither\\r\\n      sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\\r\\n      attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her\\r\\n      husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\\r\\n      marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\\r\\n      for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however\\r\\n      uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\r\\n      preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained;\\r\\n      and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been\\r\\n      handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable\\r\\n      circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to\\r\\n      Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any\\r\\n      other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame\\r\\n      her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings\\r\\n      must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her\\r\\n      the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when\\r\\n      he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\r\\n      passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of\\r\\n      course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without\\r\\n      difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst\\r\\n      forth in such very direct questions on his return as required\\r\\n      some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising\\r\\n      great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous\\r\\n      love.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any\\r\\n      of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when\\r\\n      the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great\\r\\n      politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see\\r\\n      him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him\\r\\n      to visit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\\r\\n      gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\r\\n      you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon\\r\\n      as possible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means\\r\\n      wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here,\\r\\n      my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the\\r\\n      risk of offending your patroness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to\\r\\n      you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not\\r\\n      taking so material a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather\\r\\n      than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by\\r\\n      your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly\\r\\n      probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall\\r\\n      take no offence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\r\\n      affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily\\r\\n      receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other\\r\\n      mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my\\r\\n      fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render\\r\\n      it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health\\r\\n      and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them\\r\\n      equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his\\r\\n      addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been\\r\\n      prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher\\r\\n      than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections\\r\\n      which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as\\r\\n      herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve\\r\\n      himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\r\\n      agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of\\r\\n      this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast,\\r\\n      and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of\\r\\n      the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with\\r\\n      her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or\\r\\n      two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far\\r\\n      from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her\\r\\n      astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first\\r\\n      the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling\\r\\n      her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so\\r\\n      direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected,\\r\\n      she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it\\r\\n      incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s\\r\\n      good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with\\r\\n      you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong\\r\\n      effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that\\r\\n      the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her,\\r\\n      and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be\\r\\n      surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was\\r\\n      wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it\\r\\n      over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am\\r\\n      not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable\\r\\n      home; and considering Mr. Collins’s character, connection, and\\r\\n      situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness\\r\\n      with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the\\r\\n      marriage state.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward\\r\\n      pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not\\r\\n      stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what\\r\\n      she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all\\r\\n      reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness\\r\\n      of Mr. Collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days\\r\\n      was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had\\r\\n      always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly\\r\\n      like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,\\r\\n      when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\r\\n      feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins\\r\\n      was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend\\r\\n      disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the\\r\\n      distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to\\r\\n      be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\\r\\n      what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\\r\\n      mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\\r\\n      daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many\\r\\n      compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of\\r\\n      a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter—to an\\r\\n      audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be\\r\\n      entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil,\\r\\n      boisterously exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not\\r\\n      you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\r\\n      without anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding\\r\\n      carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be\\r\\n      positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all\\r\\n      their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\\r\\n      unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\\r\\n      account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\\r\\n      herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\\r\\n      mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\\r\\n      Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\\r\\n      making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\\r\\n      expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\\r\\n      and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal\\r\\n      while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than\\r\\n      her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she\\r\\n      persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\\r\\n      was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\\r\\n      trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\\r\\n      that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were\\r\\n      plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real\\r\\n      cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been\\r\\n      barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she\\r\\n      principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\\r\\n      console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out\\r\\n      her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth\\r\\n      without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak\\r\\n      to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months\\r\\n      were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,\\r\\n      and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most\\r\\n      agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that\\r\\n      Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\\r\\n      sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\\r\\n      daughter!\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she\\r\\n      said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for\\r\\n      their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it\\r\\n      as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\\r\\n      for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\\r\\n      other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\\r\\n      retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\\r\\n      married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to\\r\\n      say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and\\r\\n      ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\\r\\n      away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept\\r\\n      them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded\\r\\n      that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.\\r\\n      Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard\\r\\n      to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her\\r\\n      opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew\\r\\n      daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and\\r\\n      nothing more was heard of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\\r\\n      counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\r\\n      The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\\r\\n      Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\\r\\n      solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth’s abode in the family\\r\\n      might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that\\r\\n      head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\\r\\n      expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\\r\\n      their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\\r\\n      was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been\\r\\n      so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\\r\\n      Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\\r\\n      fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his\\r\\n      marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\\r\\n      which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\\r\\n      amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\\r\\n      happiest of men.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\r\\n      pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much\\r\\n      disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange\\r\\n      that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\\r\\n      was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated\\r\\n      having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent,\\r\\n      and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were\\r\\n      the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the\\r\\n      greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued absence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day\\r\\n      after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him\\r\\n      than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming\\r\\n      no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly\\r\\n      incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as\\r\\n      a most scandalous falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but\\r\\n      that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\r\\n      Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s\\r\\n      happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\\r\\n      could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of\\r\\n      his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend,\\r\\n      assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of\\r\\n      London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his\\r\\n      attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\\r\\n      more painful than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she felt she was\\r\\n      desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\\r\\n      therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such\\r\\n      delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\\r\\n      she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his\\r\\n      arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come\\r\\n      back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane’s\\r\\n      steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\\r\\n      tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\\r\\n      reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been\\r\\n      on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need\\r\\n      much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of\\r\\n      love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The\\r\\n      chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\\r\\n      sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology\\r\\n      for his absence before the family went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention\\r\\n      of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of\\r\\n      ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it\\r\\n      talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her\\r\\n      successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous\\r\\n      abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded\\r\\n      her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she\\r\\n      spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were\\r\\n      talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\\r\\n      and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were\\r\\n      dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that\\r\\n      Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_\\r\\n      should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take\\r\\n      her place in it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope\\r\\n      for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the\\r\\n      survivor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,\\r\\n      instead of making any answer, she went on as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If\\r\\n      it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What should not you mind?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I should not mind anything at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\r\\n      insensibility.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\\r\\n      entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\\r\\n      estate from one’s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for\\r\\n      the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he_ have it more than\\r\\n      anybody else?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very\\r\\n      first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled\\r\\n      in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret\\r\\n      at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire before he left the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\\r\\n      rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed\\r\\n      affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss\\r\\n      Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions\\r\\n      were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their\\r\\n      increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment\\r\\n      of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She\\r\\n      wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an inmate\\r\\n      of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\\r\\n      the latter with regard to new furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all\\r\\n      this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided\\r\\n      between concern for her sister, and resentment against all\\r\\n      others. To Caroline’s assertion of her brother’s being partial to\\r\\n      Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane,\\r\\n      she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\\r\\n      always been disposed to like him, she could not think without\\r\\n      anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\\r\\n      want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\\r\\n      designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\r\\n      to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness,\\r\\n      however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\\r\\n      sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her\\r\\n      sister’s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible\\r\\n      himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be\\r\\n      long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing\\r\\n      else; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or\\r\\n      were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether he had been\\r\\n      aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\r\\n      observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\\r\\n      must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\\r\\n      situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\\r\\n      feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them\\r\\n      together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\\r\\n      and its master, she could not help saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can\\r\\n      have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\\r\\n      reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long.\\r\\n      He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\\r\\n      said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have\\r\\n      no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\\r\\n      acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or\\r\\n      fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not\\r\\n      _that_ pain. A little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to\\r\\n      get the better.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort\\r\\n      immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\\r\\n      my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your\\r\\n      sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\\r\\n      what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\\r\\n      loved you as you deserve.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw\\r\\n      back the praise on her sister’s warm affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all\\r\\n      the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.\\r\\n      _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself\\r\\n      against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my\\r\\n      encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need\\r\\n      not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of\\r\\n      whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I\\r\\n      dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the\\r\\n      inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little\\r\\n      dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\r\\n      sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not\\r\\n      mention; the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable!\\r\\n      In every view it is unaccountable!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They\\r\\n      will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for\\r\\n      difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s\\r\\n      respectability, and Charlotte’s steady, prudent character.\\r\\n      Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune,\\r\\n      it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for\\r\\n      everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like regard and\\r\\n      esteem for our cousin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\\r\\n      one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\\r\\n      persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\\r\\n      think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My\\r\\n      dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,\\r\\n      silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as\\r\\n      well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper\\r\\n      way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte\\r\\n      Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the\\r\\n      meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\\r\\n      yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility\\r\\n      of danger security for happiness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,”\\r\\n      replied Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\\r\\n      them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something\\r\\n      else. You mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you,\\r\\n      but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that\\r\\n      person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must\\r\\n      not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must\\r\\n      not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and\\r\\n      circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that\\r\\n      deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And men take care that they should.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have\\r\\n      no idea of there being so much design in the world as some\\r\\n      persons imagine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to\\r\\n      design,” said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to\\r\\n      make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.\\r\\n      Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people’s feelings,\\r\\n      and want of resolution, will do the business.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And do you impute it to either of those?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by\\r\\n      saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you\\r\\n      can.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They\\r\\n      can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no\\r\\n      other woman can secure it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides\\r\\n      his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\\r\\n      consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\\r\\n      importance of money, great connections, and pride.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied\\r\\n      Jane; “but this may be from better feelings than you are\\r\\n      supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known\\r\\n      me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their\\r\\n      own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their\\r\\n      brother’s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it,\\r\\n      unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed\\r\\n      him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so,\\r\\n      they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make\\r\\n      everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do\\r\\n      not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\\r\\n      mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison\\r\\n      of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let\\r\\n      me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be\\r\\n      understood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley’s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\\r\\n      no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\\r\\n      not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\\r\\n      considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to\\r\\n      convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\\r\\n      attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\\r\\n      transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\\r\\n      though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\\r\\n      she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best\\r\\n      comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he\\r\\n      one day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate\\r\\n      her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little\\r\\n      in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives\\r\\n      her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn\\r\\n      to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is\\r\\n      your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\\r\\n      the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a\\r\\n      pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We\\r\\n      must not all expect Jane’s good fortune.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that\\r\\n      whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\\r\\n      mother who will make the most of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the\\r\\n      gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of\\r\\n      the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other\\r\\n      recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The\\r\\n      whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly\\r\\n      acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to\\r\\n      know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had\\r\\n      known anything of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might\\r\\n      be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the\\r\\n      society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\\r\\n      pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but\\r\\n      by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 25\\r\\n\\r\\n      After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of\\r\\n      felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by\\r\\n      the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might\\r\\n      be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of\\r\\n      his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his\\r\\n      return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to\\r\\n      make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at\\r\\n      Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair\\r\\n      cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\\r\\n      another letter of thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\\r\\n      receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend\\r\\n      the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,\\r\\n      gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by\\r\\n      nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had\\r\\n      difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within\\r\\n      view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and\\r\\n      agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\\r\\n      woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.\\r\\n      Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a\\r\\n      particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in\\r\\n      town.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her arrival was to\\r\\n      distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When\\r\\n      this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her\\r\\n      turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and\\r\\n      much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she\\r\\n      last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of\\r\\n      marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard\\r\\n      to think that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this\\r\\n      time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an\\r\\n      offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of\\r\\n      it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I\\r\\n      have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as\\r\\n      ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are\\r\\n      all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so\\r\\n      it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in\\r\\n      my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\\r\\n      before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is\\r\\n      the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you\\r\\n      tell us, of long sleeves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given\\r\\n      before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with\\r\\n      her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her\\r\\n      nieces, turned the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the\\r\\n      subject. “It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\\r\\n      Jane,” said she. “I am sorry it went off. But these things happen\\r\\n      so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so\\r\\n      easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when\\r\\n      accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort\\r\\n      of inconsistencies are very frequent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it\\r\\n      will not do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not\\r\\n      often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a\\r\\n      young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom\\r\\n      he was violently in love with only a few days before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so\\r\\n      doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is\\r\\n      as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour’s\\r\\n      acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent\\r\\n      was_ Mr. Bingley’s love?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\r\\n      inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every\\r\\n      time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own\\r\\n      ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to\\r\\n      dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an\\r\\n      answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility\\r\\n      the very essence of love?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\r\\n      Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she\\r\\n      may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to\\r\\n      _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\r\\n      But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?\\r\\n      Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief\\r\\n      from home may be as useful as anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt\\r\\n      persuaded of her sister’s ready acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard\\r\\n      to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a\\r\\n      part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you\\r\\n      well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that\\r\\n      they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of\\r\\n      his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on\\r\\n      Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think\\r\\n      of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as\\r\\n      Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month’s ablution\\r\\n      enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter\\r\\n      it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does\\r\\n      not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to\\r\\n      help calling.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to\\r\\n      place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of\\r\\n      Bingley’s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude\\r\\n      on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did\\r\\n      not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes\\r\\n      she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated,\\r\\n      and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the\\r\\n      more natural influence of Jane’s attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the\\r\\n      Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than\\r\\n      as she hoped by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her\\r\\n      brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without\\r\\n      any danger of seeing him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\\r\\n      Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day\\r\\n      without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for\\r\\n      the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not\\r\\n      once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for\\r\\n      home, some of the officers always made part of it—of which\\r\\n      officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s warm\\r\\n      commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\\r\\n      them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their\\r\\n      preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little\\r\\n      uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject\\r\\n      before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the\\r\\n      imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\\r\\n      unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years\\r\\n      ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in\\r\\n      that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had,\\r\\n      therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had\\r\\n      been little there since the death of Darcy’s father, it was yet\\r\\n      in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former\\r\\n      friends than she had been in the way of procuring.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\\r\\n      character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible\\r\\n      subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley\\r\\n      with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in\\r\\n      bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late\\r\\n      possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made\\r\\n      acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she\\r\\n      tried to remember some of that gentleman’s reputed disposition\\r\\n      when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at\\r\\n      last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy\\r\\n      formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 26\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\\r\\n      given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her\\r\\n      alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went\\r\\n      on:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely\\r\\n      because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not\\r\\n      afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your\\r\\n      guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an\\r\\n      affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.\\r\\n      I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting\\r\\n      young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should\\r\\n      think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let\\r\\n      your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect\\r\\n      you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\\r\\n      good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\\r\\n      myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me,\\r\\n      if I can prevent it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love\\r\\n      with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all\\r\\n      comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes\\r\\n      really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should\\r\\n      not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!\\r\\n      My father’s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I\\r\\n      should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial\\r\\n      to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to\\r\\n      be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every\\r\\n      day that where there is affection, young people are seldom\\r\\n      withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into\\r\\n      engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than\\r\\n      so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even\\r\\n      to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise\\r\\n      you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry\\r\\n      to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with\\r\\n      him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so\\r\\n      very often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of\\r\\n      inviting him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\\r\\n      “very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do\\r\\n      not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your\\r\\n      account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You\\r\\n      know my mother’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company\\r\\n      for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do\\r\\n      what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\\r\\n      her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful\\r\\n      instance of advice being given on such a point, without being\\r\\n      resented.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been\\r\\n      quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode\\r\\n      with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at\\r\\n      length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even\\r\\n      repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she “_wished_\\r\\n      they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on\\r\\n      Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose\\r\\n      to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s ungracious and\\r\\n      reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,\\r\\n      accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs\\r\\n      together, Charlotte said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_That_ you certainly shall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me,\\r\\n      therefore, to come to Hunsford.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in\\r\\n      the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte,\\r\\n      “and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza,\\r\\n      you will be as welcome as either of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent\\r\\n      from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to\\r\\n      hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her\\r\\n      friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as\\r\\n      it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was\\r\\n      impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling\\r\\n      that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined\\r\\n      not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what\\r\\n      had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters were\\r\\n      received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\r\\n      curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she\\r\\n      would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce\\r\\n      herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt\\r\\n      that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she\\r\\n      might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with\\r\\n      comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The\\r\\n      house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her\\r\\n      taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most friendly and\\r\\n      obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and Rosings\\r\\n      rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\\r\\n      for her own visit there to know the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce\\r\\n      their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth\\r\\n      hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as\\r\\n      impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without\\r\\n      either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it,\\r\\n      however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from\\r\\n      Longbourn had by some accident been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of\\r\\n      the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in\\r\\n      Grosvenor Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\\r\\n      Bingley. “I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words,\\r\\n      “but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving\\r\\n      her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my\\r\\n      last letter had never reached her. I enquired after their\\r\\n      brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy\\r\\n      was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not\\r\\n      long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I\\r\\n      shall see them soon here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\\r\\n      accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in\\r\\n      town.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She\\r\\n      endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but\\r\\n      she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After\\r\\n      waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing\\r\\n      every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last\\r\\n      appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the\\r\\n      alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\\r\\n      longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister\\r\\n      will prove what she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\r\\n      her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to\\r\\n      have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But,\\r\\n      my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not\\r\\n      think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her\\r\\n      behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I\\r\\n      do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate\\r\\n      with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am\\r\\n      sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit\\r\\n      till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the\\r\\n      meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no\\r\\n      pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\r\\n      calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and\\r\\n      was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went\\r\\n      away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no\\r\\n      longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very\\r\\n      wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every\\r\\n      advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because\\r\\n      she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\\r\\n      very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need\\r\\n      not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to\\r\\n      be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account\\r\\n      for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his\\r\\n      sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural\\r\\n      and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such\\r\\n      fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have\\r\\n      met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from\\r\\n      something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner\\r\\n      of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is\\r\\n      really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were\\r\\n      not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say\\r\\n      that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I\\r\\n      will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of\\r\\n      what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable\\r\\n      kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\\r\\n      soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to\\r\\n      Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any\\r\\n      certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that\\r\\n      you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.\\r\\n      Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you\\r\\n      will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\\r\\n      she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister\\r\\n      at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely\\r\\n      over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\r\\n      His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for\\r\\n      him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped\\r\\n      he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy’s sister, as by Wickham’s\\r\\n      account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown\\r\\n      away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\r\\n      concerning that gentleman, and required information; and\\r\\n      Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to\\r\\n      her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided,\\r\\n      his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\r\\n      Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it\\r\\n      and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but\\r\\n      slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing\\r\\n      that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted\\r\\n      it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\\r\\n      remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering\\r\\n      himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in\\r\\n      this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his\\r\\n      wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more\\r\\n      natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few\\r\\n      struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and\\r\\n      desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\\r\\n      happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating\\r\\n      the circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear\\r\\n      aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really\\r\\n      experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present\\r\\n      detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my\\r\\n      feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even\\r\\n      impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at\\r\\n      all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good\\r\\n      sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness\\r\\n      has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\r\\n      interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in\\r\\n      love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative\\r\\n      insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.\\r\\n      Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.\\r\\n      They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the\\r\\n      mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something\\r\\n      to live on as well as the plain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 27\\r\\n\\r\\n      With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and\\r\\n      otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,\\r\\n      sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass\\r\\n      away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at\\r\\n      first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she\\r\\n      soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned\\r\\n      to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater\\r\\n      certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte\\r\\n      again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty\\r\\n      in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\r\\n      uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little\\r\\n      change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would\\r\\n      moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew\\r\\n      near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,\\r\\n      however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to\\r\\n      Charlotte’s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and\\r\\n      his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in\\r\\n      London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan\\r\\n      could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss\\r\\n      her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her\\r\\n      going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to\\r\\n      answer her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\\r\\n      friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not\\r\\n      make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and\\r\\n      to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the\\r\\n      first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu,\\r\\n      wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to\\r\\n      expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of\\r\\n      her—their opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a\\r\\n      solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to\\r\\n      him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced\\r\\n      that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of\\r\\n      the amiable and pleasing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\r\\n      think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter\\r\\n      Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had\\r\\n      nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to\\r\\n      with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth\\r\\n      loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William’s too long. He\\r\\n      could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and\\r\\n      knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his\\r\\n      information.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\\r\\n      early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching\\r\\n      their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to\\r\\n      welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was\\r\\n      pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs\\r\\n      were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their\\r\\n      cousin’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the\\r\\n      drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a\\r\\n      twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\\r\\n      kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in\\r\\n      bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object\\r\\n      was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear,\\r\\n      in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always\\r\\n      struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of\\r\\n      dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would\\r\\n      not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of\\r\\n      Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated\\r\\n      conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\\r\\n      herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given\\r\\n      up the acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and\\r\\n      complimented her on bearing it so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss\\r\\n      King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\\r\\n      affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does\\r\\n      discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid\\r\\n      of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now,\\r\\n      because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds,\\r\\n      you want to find out that he is mercenary.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall\\r\\n      know what to think.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of\\r\\n      her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But he paid her not the smallest attention till her\\r\\n      grandfather’s death made her mistress of this fortune.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No—why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\\r\\n      affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be\\r\\n      for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was\\r\\n      equally poor?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\\r\\n      towards her so soon after this event.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those\\r\\n      elegant decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does\\r\\n      not object to it, why should _we_?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her\\r\\n      being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\\r\\n      mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry,\\r\\n      you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in\\r\\n      Derbyshire.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\\r\\n      live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank\\r\\n      Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not\\r\\n      one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to\\r\\n      recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after\\r\\n      all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\\r\\n      disappointment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had\\r\\n      the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle\\r\\n      and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the\\r\\n      summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner, “but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\\r\\n      acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my\\r\\n      dear, dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what\\r\\n      felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to\\r\\n      disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and\\r\\n      mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when\\r\\n      we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\r\\n      being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know\\r\\n      where we have gone—we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes,\\r\\n      mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our\\r\\n      imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular\\r\\n      scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let\\r\\n      _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the\\r\\n      generality of travellers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 28\\r\\n\\r\\n      Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to\\r\\n      Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she\\r\\n      had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her\\r\\n      health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant\\r\\n      source of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\\r\\n      was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to\\r\\n      bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary\\r\\n      on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she\\r\\n      had heard of its inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to\\r\\n      the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the\\r\\n      laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins\\r\\n      and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at\\r\\n      the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house,\\r\\n      amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they\\r\\n      were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.\\r\\n      Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and\\r\\n      Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found\\r\\n      herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her\\r\\n      cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal\\r\\n      civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\r\\n      minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all\\r\\n      her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing\\r\\n      out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as\\r\\n      soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time,\\r\\n      with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually\\r\\n      repeated all his wife’s offers of refreshment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\\r\\n      help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the\\r\\n      room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself\\r\\n      particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had\\r\\n      lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and\\r\\n      comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of\\r\\n      repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she\\r\\n      could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.\\r\\n      Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\r\\n      ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily\\r\\n      turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a\\r\\n      faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After\\r\\n      sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the\\r\\n      room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of\\r\\n      their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\r\\n      Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was\\r\\n      large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he\\r\\n      attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\\r\\n      respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\\r\\n      countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of\\r\\n      the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\r\\n      Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and\\r\\n      scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked\\r\\n      for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\\r\\n      beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every\\r\\n      direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most\\r\\n      distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\\r\\n      the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\\r\\n      the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\\r\\n      bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was\\r\\n      a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n      From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\\r\\n      meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the\\r\\n      remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William\\r\\n      accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\\r\\n      house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\\r\\n      of showing it without her husband’s help. It was rather small,\\r\\n      but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and\\r\\n      arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave\\r\\n      Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten,\\r\\n      there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\\r\\n      Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must\\r\\n      be often forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the\\r\\n      country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when\\r\\n      Mr. Collins joining in, observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\\r\\n      Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need\\r\\n      not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and\\r\\n      condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some\\r\\n      portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any\\r\\n      hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in\\r\\n      every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.\\r\\n      Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at\\r\\n      Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her\\r\\n      ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I _should_ say,\\r\\n      one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,”\\r\\n      added Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort\\r\\n      of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\\r\\n      and telling again what had already been written; and when it\\r\\n      closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to\\r\\n      meditate upon Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand\\r\\n      her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her\\r\\n      husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She\\r\\n      had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor\\r\\n      of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A\\r\\n      lively imagination soon settled it all.\\r\\n\\r\\n      About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\\r\\n      ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole\\r\\n      house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard\\r\\n      somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly\\r\\n      after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing\\r\\n      place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out—\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\\r\\n      dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not\\r\\n      tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\\r\\n      more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the\\r\\n      lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a\\r\\n      low phaeton at the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the\\r\\n      pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady\\r\\n      Catherine and her daughter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is\\r\\n      not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives\\r\\n      with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is\\r\\n      quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be\\r\\n      so thin and small?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all\\r\\n      this wind. Why does she not come in?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of\\r\\n      favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\r\\n      “She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well.\\r\\n      She will make him a very proper wife.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\\r\\n      conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s\\r\\n      high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest\\r\\n      contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing\\r\\n      whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\\r\\n      and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw\\r\\n      the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good\\r\\n      fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the\\r\\n      whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 29\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\\r\\n      complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\\r\\n      to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\\r\\n      towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for;\\r\\n      and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was\\r\\n      such an instance of Lady Catherine’s condescension, as he knew\\r\\n      not how to admire enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all\\r\\n      surprised by her ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and\\r\\n      spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my\\r\\n      knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could\\r\\n      have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined\\r\\n      that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an\\r\\n      invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately\\r\\n      after your arrival!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir\\r\\n      William, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great\\r\\n      really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\r\\n      About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\\r\\n      uncommon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but\\r\\n      their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\\r\\n      them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\\r\\n      so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\\r\\n      overpower them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\\r\\n      Elizabeth—\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.\\r\\n      Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us\\r\\n      which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely\\r\\n      to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there\\r\\n      is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think\\r\\n      the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the\\r\\n      distinction of rank preserved.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\\r\\n      different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\\r\\n      Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\r\\n      Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\\r\\n      living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\\r\\n      company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\\r\\n      with as much apprehension as her father had done to his\\r\\n      presentation at St. James’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\r\\n      mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its\\r\\n      prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she\\r\\n      could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene\\r\\n      to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of\\r\\n      the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\\r\\n      glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every\\r\\n      moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly\\r\\n      calm. Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing\\r\\n      of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary\\r\\n      talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money\\r\\n      or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\r\\n      rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\\r\\n      they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\\r\\n      where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\\r\\n      sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\\r\\n      them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that\\r\\n      the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\\r\\n      proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he\\r\\n      would have thought necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so\\r\\n      completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but\\r\\n      just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat\\r\\n      without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of\\r\\n      her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way\\r\\n      to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and\\r\\n      could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady\\r\\n      Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,\\r\\n      which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\\r\\n      conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to\\r\\n      make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not\\r\\n      rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken\\r\\n      in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and\\r\\n      brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and from the\\r\\n      observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to\\r\\n      be exactly what he represented.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\\r\\n      deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she\\r\\n      turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in\\r\\n      Maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was\\r\\n      neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss\\r\\n      de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain,\\r\\n      were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low\\r\\n      voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing\\r\\n      remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she\\r\\n      said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her\\r\\n      eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\\r\\n      windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point\\r\\n      out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that\\r\\n      it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\\r\\n      servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\\r\\n      promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\\r\\n      the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as\\r\\n      if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,\\r\\n      and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\\r\\n      commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\\r\\n      enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\r\\n      manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But\\r\\n      Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,\\r\\n      and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the\\r\\n      table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much\\r\\n      conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an\\r\\n      opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de\\r\\n      Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady\\r\\n      Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.\\r\\n      Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss\\r\\n      de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\\r\\n      she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\\r\\n      and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\\r\\n      be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without\\r\\n      any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on\\r\\n      every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not\\r\\n      used to have her judgement controverted. She enquired into\\r\\n      Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a\\r\\n      great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her\\r\\n      how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as\\r\\n      hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her\\r\\n      poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great\\r\\n      lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of\\r\\n      dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.\\r\\n      Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\\r\\n      Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she\\r\\n      knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very\\r\\n      genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times,\\r\\n      how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than\\r\\n      herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether\\r\\n      they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage\\r\\n      her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name?\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered\\r\\n      them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For\\r\\n      your sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise\\r\\n      I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It\\r\\n      was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you\\r\\n      play and sing, Miss Bennet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “A little.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\\r\\n      instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try\\r\\n      it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “One of them does.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The\\r\\n      Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\\r\\n      as yours. Do you draw?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, not at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What, none of you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your\\r\\n      mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit\\r\\n      of masters.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\\r\\n      London.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Has your governess left you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We never had any governess.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up\\r\\n      at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your\\r\\n      mother must have been quite a slave to your education.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\\r\\n      not been the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess,\\r\\n      you must have been neglected.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\\r\\n      as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always\\r\\n      encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\r\\n      Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if\\r\\n      I had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\r\\n      strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be\\r\\n      done in education without steady and regular instruction, and\\r\\n      nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many\\r\\n      families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am\\r\\n      always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of\\r\\n      Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means;\\r\\n      and it was but the other day that I recommended another young\\r\\n      person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the\\r\\n      family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you\\r\\n      of Lady Metcalf’s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss\\r\\n      Pope a treasure. ‘Lady Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a\\r\\n      treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, ma’am, all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the\\r\\n      second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!\\r\\n      Your younger sisters must be very young?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to\\r\\n      be much in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very\\r\\n      hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share\\r\\n      of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the\\r\\n      means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a\\r\\n      right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back\\r\\n      on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to\\r\\n      promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very\\r\\n      decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n      smiling, “your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\\r\\n      answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\\r\\n      who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\\r\\n      not conceal your age.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am not one-and-twenty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\\r\\n      card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and\\r\\n      Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose\\r\\n      to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting\\r\\n      Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was\\r\\n      superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did\\r\\n      not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\\r\\n      fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having\\r\\n      too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\\r\\n      other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the\\r\\n      mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\\r\\n      herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her\\r\\n      ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\\r\\n      apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not\\r\\n      say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\\r\\n      names.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they\\r\\n      chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to\\r\\n      Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The\\r\\n      party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\\r\\n      determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From\\r\\n      these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the\\r\\n      coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s\\r\\n      side and as many bows on Sir William’s they departed. As soon as\\r\\n      they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\\r\\n      cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings,\\r\\n      which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it\\r\\n      really was. But her commendation, though costing her some\\r\\n      trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very\\r\\n      soon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise into his own hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 30\\r\\n\\r\\n      Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was\\r\\n      long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most\\r\\n      comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\\r\\n      such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William\\r\\n      was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out\\r\\n      in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away,\\r\\n      the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\\r\\n      Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\r\\n      cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between\\r\\n      breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the\\r\\n      garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window\\r\\n      in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which\\r\\n      the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather\\r\\n      wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for\\r\\n      common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant\\r\\n      aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason\\r\\n      for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\\r\\n      much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally\\r\\n      lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n      From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,\\r\\n      and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what\\r\\n      carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh\\r\\n      drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform\\r\\n      them of, though it happened almost every day. She not\\r\\n      unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’\\r\\n      conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon\\r\\n      to get out.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\\r\\n      Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\\r\\n      necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that\\r\\n      there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could\\r\\n      not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they\\r\\n      were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped\\r\\n      her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.\\r\\n      She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and\\r\\n      advised them to do it differently; found fault with the\\r\\n      arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in\\r\\n      negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it\\r\\n      only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of\\r\\n      meat were too large for her family.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\r\\n      the commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active\\r\\n      magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were\\r\\n      carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers\\r\\n      were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she\\r\\n      sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,\\r\\n      silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a\\r\\n      week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being\\r\\n      only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was\\r\\n      the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few,\\r\\n      as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond\\r\\n      Mr. Collins’s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and\\r\\n      upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were\\r\\n      half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the\\r\\n      weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great\\r\\n      enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\\r\\n      frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine,\\r\\n      was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where\\r\\n      there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but\\r\\n      herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s\\r\\n      curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed\\r\\n      away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to\\r\\n      bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a\\r\\n      circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her\\r\\n      arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few\\r\\n      weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom\\r\\n      she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively\\r\\n      new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused\\r\\n      in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him were, by his\\r\\n      behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by\\r\\n      Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\\r\\n      satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration,\\r\\n      and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been\\r\\n      frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was\\r\\n      walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into\\r\\n      Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and\\r\\n      after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park,\\r\\n      hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following\\r\\n      morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\\r\\n      two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had\\r\\n      brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his\\r\\n      uncle Lord ——, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\\r\\n      Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte\\r\\n      had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and\\r\\n      immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour\\r\\n      they might expect, adding:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      would never have come so soon to wait upon me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the\\r\\n      compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell,\\r\\n      and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not\\r\\n      handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire—paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to\\r\\n      Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\r\\n      friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth\\r\\n      merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\r\\n      readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very\\r\\n      pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight\\r\\n      observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some\\r\\n      time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his\\r\\n      civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the\\r\\n      health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and\\r\\n      after a moment’s pause, added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you\\r\\n      never happened to see her there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\\r\\n      see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed\\r\\n      between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little\\r\\n      confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to\\r\\n      meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the\\r\\n      gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 31\\r\\n\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the\\r\\n      Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably\\r\\n      to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some\\r\\n      days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for\\r\\n      while there were visitors in the house, they could not be\\r\\n      necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after\\r\\n      the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by such an\\r\\n      attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\r\\n      come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very\\r\\n      little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\n      called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy they had seen only at church.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\\r\\n      joined the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her ladyship\\r\\n      received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by\\r\\n      no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she\\r\\n      was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them,\\r\\n      especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the\\r\\n      room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was\\r\\n      a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty\\r\\n      friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated\\r\\n      himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and\\r\\n      Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books\\r\\n      and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained\\r\\n      in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and\\r\\n      flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well\\r\\n      as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\r\\n      towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,\\r\\n      after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged,\\r\\n      for she did not scruple to call out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are\\r\\n      talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it\\r\\n      is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able\\r\\n      to avoid a reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my\\r\\n      delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are\\r\\n      speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose,\\r\\n      who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better\\r\\n      natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great\\r\\n      proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to\\r\\n      apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.\\r\\n      How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s\\r\\n      proficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady\\r\\n      Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to\\r\\n      excel if she does not practice a good deal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such\\r\\n      advice. She practises very constantly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next\\r\\n      write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\\r\\n      account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is\\r\\n      to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet\\r\\n      several times, that she will never play really well unless she\\r\\n      practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is\\r\\n      very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every\\r\\n      day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson’s room. She\\r\\n      would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part of the house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and\\r\\n      made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of\\r\\n      having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the\\r\\n      instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to\\r\\n      half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew;\\r\\n      till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual\\r\\n      deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to\\r\\n      command a full view of the fair performer’s countenance.\\r\\n      Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient\\r\\n      pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state\\r\\n      to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play\\r\\n      so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to\\r\\n      be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at\\r\\n      every attempt to intimidate me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you\\r\\n      could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming\\r\\n      you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough\\r\\n      to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing\\r\\n      opinions which in fact are not your own.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said\\r\\n      to Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty\\r\\n      notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am\\r\\n      particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose\\r\\n      my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to\\r\\n      pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it\\r\\n      is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my\\r\\n      disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very\\r\\n      impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\\r\\n      things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among\\r\\n      strangers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very\\r\\n      dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,\\r\\n      you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think\\r\\n      he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;\\r\\n      and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was\\r\\n      sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the\\r\\n      fact.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the\\r\\n      assembly beyond my own party.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your\\r\\n      orders.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought\\r\\n      an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to\\r\\n      strangers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth,\\r\\n      still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man\\r\\n      of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill\\r\\n      qualified to recommend himself to strangers?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying\\r\\n      to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said\\r\\n      Darcy, “of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\r\\n      I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested\\r\\n      in their concerns, as I often see done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument\\r\\n      in the masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have\\r\\n      not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same\\r\\n      expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own\\r\\n      fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is\\r\\n      not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other\\r\\n      woman’s of superior execution.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have\\r\\n      employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege\\r\\n      of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us\\r\\n      perform to strangers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\\r\\n      know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began\\r\\n      playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening\\r\\n      for a few minutes, said to Darcy:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,\\r\\n      and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very\\r\\n      good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to\\r\\n      Anne’s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her\\r\\n      health allowed her to learn.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\\r\\n      cousin’s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other\\r\\n      could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his\\r\\n      behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss\\r\\n      Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_,\\r\\n      had she been his relation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance,\\r\\n      mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.\\r\\n      Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility,\\r\\n      and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument\\r\\n      till her ladyship’s carriage was ready to take them all home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 32\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\\r\\n      Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the\\r\\n      village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain\\r\\n      signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it\\r\\n      not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension\\r\\n      was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape\\r\\n      all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very\\r\\n      great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for\\r\\n      his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the\\r\\n      ladies were to be within.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were\\r\\n      made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was\\r\\n      absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in\\r\\n      this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on\\r\\n      the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley\\r\\n      to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he\\r\\n      went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope,\\r\\n      when you left London?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perfectly so, I thank you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a\\r\\n      short pause added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\\r\\n      ever returning to Netherfield again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may\\r\\n      spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many\\r\\n      friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements\\r\\n      are continually increasing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better\\r\\n      for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely,\\r\\n      for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But,\\r\\n      perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the\\r\\n      convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must\\r\\n      expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it\\r\\n      up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\\r\\n      friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to\\r\\n      leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very\\r\\n      comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to\\r\\n      it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\\r\\n      kindness on a more grateful object.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\\r\\n      wife.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\\r\\n      one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him,\\r\\n      or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent\\r\\n      understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her\\r\\n      marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems\\r\\n      perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is\\r\\n      certainly a very good match for her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\r\\n      distance of her own family and friends.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a\\r\\n      day’s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I should never have considered the distance as one of the\\r\\n      _advantages_ of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have\\r\\n      said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything\\r\\n      beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would\\r\\n      appear far.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she\\r\\n      understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\\r\\n      Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\\r\\n      her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on\\r\\n      many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the\\r\\n      expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But\\r\\n      that is not the case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a\\r\\n      comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent\\r\\n      journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself\\r\\n      _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_\\r\\n      cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_\\r\\n      cannot have been always at Longbourn.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change\\r\\n      of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the\\r\\n      table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Are you pleased with Kent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either\\r\\n      side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of\\r\\n      Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The\\r\\n      _tête-à-tête_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which\\r\\n      had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a\\r\\n      few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he\\r\\n      was gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he\\r\\n      would never have called on us in this familiar way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very\\r\\n      likely, even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after\\r\\n      various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to\\r\\n      proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was\\r\\n      the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were\\r\\n      over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a\\r\\n      billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and\\r\\n      in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk\\r\\n      to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\\r\\n      temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\r\\n      They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\r\\n      separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by\\r\\n      their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\n      came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which\\r\\n      of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded\\r\\n      by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his\\r\\n      evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George\\r\\n      Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less\\r\\n      captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she\\r\\n      believed he might have the best informed mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\\r\\n      difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he\\r\\n      frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his\\r\\n      lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity\\r\\n      rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to\\r\\n      himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew\\r\\n      not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally\\r\\n      laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally\\r\\n      different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\\r\\n      her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the\\r\\n      effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she\\r\\n      set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him\\r\\n      whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford;\\r\\n      but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a\\r\\n      great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It\\r\\n      was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether\\r\\n      there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing\\r\\n      but absence of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of\\r\\n      his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the\\r\\n      idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the\\r\\n      subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only\\r\\n      end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a\\r\\n      doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would vanish, if she could\\r\\n      suppose him to be in her power.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her\\r\\n      marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most\\r\\n      pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life\\r\\n      was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin\\r\\n      could have none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 33\\r\\n\\r\\n      More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\r\\n      unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\\r\\n      mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought,\\r\\n      and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him\\r\\n      at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could\\r\\n      occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and\\r\\n      even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary\\r\\n      penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal\\r\\n      enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually\\r\\n      thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never\\r\\n      said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of\\r\\n      talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of\\r\\n      their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected\\r\\n      questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of\\r\\n      solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s\\r\\n      happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly\\r\\n      understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she\\r\\n      came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words\\r\\n      seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his\\r\\n      thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an\\r\\n      allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a\\r\\n      little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\\r\\n      pales opposite the Parsonage.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last\\r\\n      letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had\\r\\n      not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was\\r\\n      meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a\\r\\n      smile, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I\\r\\n      generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at\\r\\n      the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, I should have turned in a moment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\\r\\n      Parsonage together.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his\\r\\n      disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\\r\\n      least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know\\r\\n      anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes\\r\\n      than Mr. Darcy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam. “But so we all do. It is only that he has better\\r\\n      means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many\\r\\n      others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must\\r\\n      be inured to self-denial and dependence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little\\r\\n      of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial\\r\\n      and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money\\r\\n      from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a\\r\\n      fancy for?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have\\r\\n      experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of\\r\\n      greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons\\r\\n      cannot marry where they like.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very\\r\\n      often do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not\\r\\n      many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some\\r\\n      attention to money.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at\\r\\n      the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And\\r\\n      pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless\\r\\n      the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask\\r\\n      above fifty thousand pounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To\\r\\n      interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with\\r\\n      what had passed, she soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the\\r\\n      sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not\\r\\n      marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But,\\r\\n      perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is\\r\\n      under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he\\r\\n      must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of\\r\\n      Miss Darcy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make?\\r\\n      Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age\\r\\n      are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the\\r\\n      true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\\r\\n      manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss\\r\\n      Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she\\r\\n      had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly\\r\\n      replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I\\r\\n      dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\r\\n      She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my\\r\\n      acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard\\r\\n      you say that you know them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\\r\\n      man—he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him\\r\\n      in those points where he most wants care. From something that he\\r\\n      told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley\\r\\n      very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I\\r\\n      have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It\\r\\n      was all conjecture.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What is it you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\\r\\n      known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it\\r\\n      would be an unpleasant thing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\\r\\n      Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated\\r\\n      himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences\\r\\n      of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any\\r\\n      other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from\\r\\n      believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that\\r\\n      sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of\\r\\n      last summer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I understood that there were some very strong objections against\\r\\n      the lady.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And what arts did he use to separate them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam,\\r\\n      smiling. “He only told me what I have now told you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\\r\\n      indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her\\r\\n      why she was so thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your\\r\\n      cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\\r\\n      judge?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety\\r\\n      of his friend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement\\r\\n      alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend\\r\\n      was to be happy. But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as\\r\\n      we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.\\r\\n      It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the\\r\\n      case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is\\r\\n      a lessening of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a\\r\\n      picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an\\r\\n      answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked\\r\\n      on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There,\\r\\n      shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she\\r\\n      could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It\\r\\n      was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than\\r\\n      those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the\\r\\n      world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless\\r\\n      influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to\\r\\n      separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\\r\\n      always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\\r\\n      arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead\\r\\n      him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of\\r\\n      all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had\\r\\n      ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most\\r\\n      affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say\\r\\n      how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam’s words; and those strong objections probably\\r\\n      were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and\\r\\n      another who was in business in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility\\r\\n      of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her\\r\\n      understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners\\r\\n      captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father,\\r\\n      who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will\\r\\n      probably never reach.” When she thought of her mother, her\\r\\n      confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any\\r\\n      objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\r\\n      pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the\\r\\n      want of importance in his friend’s connections, than from their\\r\\n      want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had\\r\\n      been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by\\r\\n      the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on\\r\\n      a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that,\\r\\n      added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her\\r\\n      not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to\\r\\n      drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did\\r\\n      not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband\\r\\n      from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his\\r\\n      apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather displeased by her\\r\\n      staying at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 34\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate\\r\\n      herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her\\r\\n      employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had\\r\\n      written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual\\r\\n      complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any\\r\\n      communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost\\r\\n      every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which\\r\\n      had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding\\r\\n      from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\r\\n      disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\r\\n      Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of\\r\\n      uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the\\r\\n      first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he had\\r\\n      been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister’s\\r\\n      sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to\\r\\n      Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still\\r\\n      greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with\\r\\n      Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\r\\n      spirits, by all that affection could do.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering\\r\\n      that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\n      made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as\\r\\n      he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound\\r\\n      of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the\\r\\n      idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once\\r\\n      before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire\\r\\n      particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her\\r\\n      spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter\\r\\n      amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried\\r\\n      manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing\\r\\n      his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered\\r\\n      him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then\\r\\n      getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\\r\\n      said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came\\r\\n      towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not\\r\\n      be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire\\r\\n      and love you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared,\\r\\n      coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient\\r\\n      encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long\\r\\n      felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were\\r\\n      feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was\\r\\n      not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His\\r\\n      sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family\\r\\n      obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on\\r\\n      with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was\\r\\n      wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be\\r\\n      insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection, and\\r\\n      though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at\\r\\n      first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to\\r\\n      resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in\\r\\n      anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with\\r\\n      patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\\r\\n      representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in\\r\\n      spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer;\\r\\n      and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her\\r\\n      acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see\\r\\n      that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of\\r\\n      apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\\r\\n      security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and,\\r\\n      when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\r\\n      express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\\r\\n      unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation\\r\\n      should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now\\r\\n      thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion,\\r\\n      and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry\\r\\n      to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously\\r\\n      done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings\\r\\n      which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of\\r\\n      your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after\\r\\n      this explanation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes\\r\\n      fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less\\r\\n      resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger,\\r\\n      and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He\\r\\n      was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not\\r\\n      open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The\\r\\n      pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings dreadful. At length, with a\\r\\n      voice of forced calmness, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of\\r\\n      expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\\r\\n      little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of\\r\\n      small importance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I might as well enquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a\\r\\n      desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that\\r\\n      you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even\\r\\n      against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility,\\r\\n      if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I\\r\\n      have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been\\r\\n      indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\\r\\n      any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been\\r\\n      the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\\r\\n      beloved sister?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the\\r\\n      emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to\\r\\n      interrupt her while she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive\\r\\n      can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You\\r\\n      dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if\\r\\n      not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing\\r\\n      one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and\\r\\n      the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving\\r\\n      them both in misery of the acutest kind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\\r\\n      listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any\\r\\n      feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of\\r\\n      affected incredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of\\r\\n      denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend\\r\\n      from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_\\r\\n      I have been kinder than towards myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil\\r\\n      reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\\r\\n      conciliate her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my\\r\\n      dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of\\r\\n      you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which\\r\\n      I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject,\\r\\n      what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can\\r\\n      you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you\\r\\n      here impose upon others?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said\\r\\n      Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling\\r\\n      an interest in him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his\\r\\n      misfortunes have been great indeed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have\\r\\n      reduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty.\\r\\n      You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been\\r\\n      designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of\\r\\n      that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You\\r\\n      have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his\\r\\n      misfortune with contempt and ridicule.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the\\r\\n      room, “is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you\\r\\n      hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,\\r\\n      according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,”\\r\\n      added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, “these\\r\\n      offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt\\r\\n      by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented\\r\\n      my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might\\r\\n      have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my\\r\\n      struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled\\r\\n      by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection,\\r\\n      by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor\\r\\n      am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\\r\\n      just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\\r\\n      connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations,\\r\\n      whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\\r\\n      tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of\\r\\n      your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared\\r\\n      me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you\\r\\n      behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she\\r\\n      continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\\r\\n      way that would have tempted me to accept it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\\r\\n      expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost\\r\\n      say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with\\r\\n      the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your\\r\\n      selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form\\r\\n      the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have\\r\\n      built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month\\r\\n      before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I\\r\\n      could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\\r\\n      feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have\\r\\n      been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and\\r\\n      accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth\\r\\n      heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\\r\\n      to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried\\r\\n      for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had\\r\\n      passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should\\r\\n      receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have\\r\\n      been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to\\r\\n      wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made\\r\\n      him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must\\r\\n      appear at least with equal force in his own case—was almost\\r\\n      incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so\\r\\n      strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride—his\\r\\n      shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his\\r\\n      unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not\\r\\n      justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to\\r\\n      deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\\r\\n      attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very\\r\\n      agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage\\r\\n      made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte’s\\r\\n      observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 35\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and\\r\\n      meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not\\r\\n      yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was\\r\\n      impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for\\r\\n      employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge\\r\\n      herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her\\r\\n      favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes\\r\\n      coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she\\r\\n      turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\\r\\n      park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\\r\\n      passed one of the gates into the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she\\r\\n      was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the\\r\\n      gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now\\r\\n      passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and\\r\\n      every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was\\r\\n      on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of\\r\\n      a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was\\r\\n      moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was\\r\\n      directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near\\r\\n      enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\r\\n      pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself\\r\\n      called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she\\r\\n      moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it\\r\\n      also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took,\\r\\n      said, with a look of haughty composure, “I have been walking in\\r\\n      the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me\\r\\n      the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a slight bow,\\r\\n      turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest\\r\\n      curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still\\r\\n      increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of\\r\\n      letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The\\r\\n      envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the\\r\\n      lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight\\r\\n      o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:—\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\\r\\n      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments\\r\\n      or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to\\r\\n      you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\\r\\n      myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,\\r\\n      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation\\r\\n      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\\r\\n      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.\\r\\n      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your\\r\\n      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but\\r\\n      I demand it of your justice.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of\\r\\n      equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first\\r\\n      mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I\\r\\n      had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I\\r\\n      had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\\r\\n      humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\\r\\n      prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown\\r\\n      off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my\\r\\n      father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on\\r\\n      our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its\\r\\n      exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two\\r\\n      young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few\\r\\n      weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that\\r\\n      blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each\\r\\n      circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the\\r\\n      following account of my actions and their motives has been read.\\r\\n      If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am\\r\\n      under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive\\r\\n      to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be\\r\\n      obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\\r\\n      with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any\\r\\n      other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening\\r\\n      of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his\\r\\n      feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love\\r\\n      before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you,\\r\\n      I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\\r\\n      information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given\\r\\n      rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it\\r\\n      as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\r\\n      From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively;\\r\\n      and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\\r\\n      beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\\r\\n      watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging\\r\\n      as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I\\r\\n      remained convinced from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she\\r\\n      received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by\\r\\n      any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\\r\\n      here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of\\r\\n      your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have\\r\\n      been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment\\r\\n      has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,\\r\\n      that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such\\r\\n      as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,\\r\\n      however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily\\r\\n      touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\\r\\n      certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and\\r\\n      decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did\\r\\n      not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed\\r\\n      it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My\\r\\n      objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\\r\\n      night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion\\r\\n      to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be\\r\\n      so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other\\r\\n      causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and\\r\\n      existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself\\r\\n      endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\\r\\n      me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of\\r\\n      your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\r\\n      comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so\\r\\n      almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger\\r\\n      sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It\\r\\n      pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects\\r\\n      of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\r\\n      representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider\\r\\n      that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\\r\\n      the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and\\r\\n      your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and\\r\\n      disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what\\r\\n      passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and\\r\\n      every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to\\r\\n      preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\r\\n      connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,\\r\\n      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\\r\\n      returning.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’\\r\\n      uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence\\r\\n      of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time\\r\\n      was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on\\r\\n      joining him directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I\\r\\n      readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the\\r\\n      certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them\\r\\n      earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or\\r\\n      delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would\\r\\n      ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded\\r\\n      by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s\\r\\n      indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection\\r\\n      with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\\r\\n      natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than\\r\\n      on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived\\r\\n      himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against\\r\\n      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\\r\\n      given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself\\r\\n      for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in\\r\\n      the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it\\r\\n      is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to\\r\\n      conceal from him your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself,\\r\\n      as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet\\r\\n      ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence\\r\\n      is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough\\r\\n      extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\\r\\n      concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,\\r\\n      and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more\\r\\n      to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\\r\\n      sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives\\r\\n      which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient,\\r\\n      I have not yet learnt to condemn them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having\\r\\n      injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you\\r\\n      the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has\\r\\n      _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what\\r\\n      I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted\\r\\n      veracity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\\r\\n      many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose\\r\\n      good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my\\r\\n      father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was\\r\\n      his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My\\r\\n      father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most\\r\\n      important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the\\r\\n      extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a\\r\\n      gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this young\\r\\n      man’s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also\\r\\n      the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his\\r\\n      profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it\\r\\n      is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very\\r\\n      different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle,\\r\\n      which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best\\r\\n      friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly\\r\\n      the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing\\r\\n      him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here\\r\\n      again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But\\r\\n      whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\\r\\n      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\\r\\n      real character—it adds even another motive.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My excellent father died about five years ago; and his\\r\\n      attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his\\r\\n      will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\\r\\n      advancement in the best manner that his profession might\\r\\n      allow—and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family\\r\\n      living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a\\r\\n      legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\\r\\n      survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against\\r\\n      taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for\\r\\n      him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of\\r\\n      the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some\\r\\n      intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that\\r\\n      the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient\\r\\n      support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be\\r\\n      sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\\r\\n      proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;\\r\\n      the business was therefore soon settled—he resigned all claim to\\r\\n      assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be\\r\\n      in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three\\r\\n      thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved.\\r\\n      I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his\\r\\n      society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his\\r\\n      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all\\r\\n      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For\\r\\n      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of\\r\\n      the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he\\r\\n      applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\\r\\n      circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in\\r\\n      believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most\\r\\n      unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being\\r\\n      ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of\\r\\n      which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well\\r\\n      assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could\\r\\n      not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\\r\\n      hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\\r\\n      resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in\\r\\n      proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was\\r\\n      doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\\r\\n      reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of\\r\\n      acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last\\r\\n      summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\\r\\n      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should\\r\\n      induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I\\r\\n      feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten\\r\\n      years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s\\r\\n      nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she\\r\\n      was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in\\r\\n      London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over\\r\\n      it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly\\r\\n      by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance\\r\\n      between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most\\r\\n      unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far\\r\\n      recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart\\r\\n      retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child,\\r\\n      that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent\\r\\n      to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\\r\\n      excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that\\r\\n      I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly\\r\\n      a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana,\\r\\n      unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother\\r\\n      whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole\\r\\n      to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my\\r\\n      sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I\\r\\n      wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.\\r\\n      Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s chief\\r\\n      object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\\r\\n      thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of\\r\\n      revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge\\r\\n      would have been complete indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\\r\\n      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject\\r\\n      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\\r\\n      towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form\\r\\n      of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not\\r\\n      perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of\\r\\n      everything concerning either, detection could not be in your\\r\\n      power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last\\r\\n      night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what\\r\\n      could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\\r\\n      related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of\\r\\n      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant\\r\\n      intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father’s\\r\\n      will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of\\r\\n      these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_\\r\\n      assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause\\r\\n      from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the\\r\\n      possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some\\r\\n      opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of\\r\\n      the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “FITZWILLIAM DARCY”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 36\\r\\n\\r\\n      If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect\\r\\n      it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no\\r\\n      expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may\\r\\n      well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a\\r\\n      contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read\\r\\n      were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first\\r\\n      understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\\r\\n      steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\r\\n      to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a\\r\\n      strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his\\r\\n      account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an\\r\\n      eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from\\r\\n      impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was\\r\\n      incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.\\r\\n      His belief of her sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved\\r\\n      to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to\\r\\n      the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him\\r\\n      justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which\\r\\n      satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was\\r\\n      all pride and insolence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham—when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation\\r\\n      of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion\\r\\n      of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own\\r\\n      history of himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and\\r\\n      more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and\\r\\n      even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely,\\r\\n      repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false! This cannot be! This\\r\\n      must be the grossest falsehood!”—and when she had gone through\\r\\n      the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last\\r\\n      page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\\r\\n      regard it, that she would never look in it again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\r\\n      nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the\\r\\n      letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she\\r\\n      could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related\\r\\n      to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the\\r\\n      meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the\\r\\n      Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the\\r\\n      kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known\\r\\n      its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each\\r\\n      recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the\\r\\n      difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was\\r\\n      fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\\r\\n      impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side\\r\\n      or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that\\r\\n      her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the\\r\\n      closest attention, the particulars immediately following of\\r\\n      Wickham’s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his\\r\\n      receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds,\\r\\n      again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter,\\r\\n      weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\\r\\n      impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but\\r\\n      with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again\\r\\n      she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,\\r\\n      which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could\\r\\n      so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than\\r\\n      infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely\\r\\n      blameless throughout the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to\\r\\n      lay at Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more\\r\\n      so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never\\r\\n      heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in\\r\\n      which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on\\r\\n      meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight\\r\\n      acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character,\\r\\n      had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of\\r\\n      enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him\\r\\n      at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect\\r\\n      some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity\\r\\n      or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for\\r\\n      those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’\\r\\n      continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could\\r\\n      see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address;\\r\\n      but she could remember no more substantial good than the general\\r\\n      approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social\\r\\n      powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a\\r\\n      considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas!\\r\\n      the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received\\r\\n      some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she\\r\\n      was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the\\r\\n      information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and\\r\\n      whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she\\r\\n      had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked\\r\\n      by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly\\r\\n      banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have\\r\\n      hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\\r\\n      cousin’s corroboration.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\\r\\n      conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening\\r\\n      at Mr. Phillips’s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in\\r\\n      her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such\\r\\n      communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her\\r\\n      before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he\\r\\n      had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his\\r\\n      conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of\\r\\n      seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\\r\\n      _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield\\r\\n      ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the\\r\\n      Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story\\r\\n      to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been\\r\\n      everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples\\r\\n      in sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he had assured her that\\r\\n      respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.\\r\\n\\r\\n      How differently did everything now appear in which he was\\r\\n      concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence\\r\\n      of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of\\r\\n      her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but\\r\\n      his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself\\r\\n      could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been\\r\\n      deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his\\r\\n      vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had\\r\\n      most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour\\r\\n      grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned\\r\\n      by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;\\r\\n      that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in\\r\\n      the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had\\r\\n      latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of\\r\\n      intimacy with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be\\r\\n      unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or\\r\\n      immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed\\r\\n      and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother,\\r\\n      and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\\r\\n      sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had\\r\\n      his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a\\r\\n      violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed\\r\\n      from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of\\r\\n      it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor\\r\\n      Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,\\r\\n      partial, prejudiced, absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided\\r\\n      myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my\\r\\n      abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my\\r\\n      sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\r\\n      How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation!\\r\\n      Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\r\\n      But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the\\r\\n      preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on\\r\\n      the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\r\\n      prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either\\r\\n      were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a\\r\\n      line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s\\r\\n      explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read\\r\\n      it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\r\\n      How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,\\r\\n      which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared\\r\\n      himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment;\\r\\n      and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had\\r\\n      always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his\\r\\n      description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though\\r\\n      fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\\r\\n      complacency in her air and manner not often united with great\\r\\n      sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\r\\n      mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her\\r\\n      sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her\\r\\n      too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he\\r\\n      particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball,\\r\\n      and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have\\r\\n      made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It\\r\\n      soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had\\r\\n      thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she\\r\\n      considered that Jane’s disappointment had in fact been the work\\r\\n      of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit\\r\\n      of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt\\r\\n      depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\\r\\n      variety of thought—re-considering events, determining\\r\\n      probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to\\r\\n      a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection\\r\\n      of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she\\r\\n      entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,\\r\\n      and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make\\r\\n      her unfit for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had\\r\\n      each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few\\r\\n      minutes, to take leave—but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been\\r\\n      sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and\\r\\n      almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\r\\n      Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she\\r\\n      really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an\\r\\n      object; she could think only of her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 37\\r\\n\\r\\n      The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins\\r\\n      having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting\\r\\n      obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of\\r\\n      their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits\\r\\n      as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone\\r\\n      through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady\\r\\n      Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with\\r\\n      great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that\\r\\n      she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having\\r\\n      them all to dine with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\\r\\n      had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to\\r\\n      her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of\\r\\n      what her ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she\\r\\n      have said? how would she have behaved?” were questions with which\\r\\n      she amused herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I\\r\\n      assure you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I\\r\\n      believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I\\r\\n      am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be\\r\\n      so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so\\r\\n      they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably\\r\\n      till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,\\r\\n      more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings\\r\\n      certainly increases.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\\r\\n      which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\\r\\n      out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by\\r\\n      supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she\\r\\n      added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg\\r\\n      that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad\\r\\n      of your company, I am sure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,”\\r\\n      replied Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I\\r\\n      must be in town next Saturday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I\\r\\n      expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before\\r\\n      you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\r\\n      Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if\\r\\n      you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to\\r\\n      take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in\\r\\n      June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the\\r\\n      barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and\\r\\n      indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not\\r\\n      object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\\r\\n      original plan.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a\\r\\n      servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot\\r\\n      bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.\\r\\n      It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have\\r\\n      the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young\\r\\n      women should always be properly guarded and attended, according\\r\\n      to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to\\r\\n      Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two\\r\\n      men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy,\\r\\n      of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\\r\\n      propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to\\r\\n      all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.\\r\\n      Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would\\r\\n      really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My uncle is to send a servant for us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad\\r\\n      you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you\\r\\n      change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at\\r\\n      the Bell, you will be attended to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\\r\\n      journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention\\r\\n      was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or,\\r\\n      with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\r\\n      Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was\\r\\n      alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day\\r\\n      went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in\\r\\n      all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by\\r\\n      heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its\\r\\n      writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the\\r\\n      style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when\\r\\n      she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,\\r\\n      her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed\\r\\n      feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited\\r\\n      gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not\\r\\n      approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\\r\\n      feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own\\r\\n      past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and\\r\\n      regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of\\r\\n      yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father,\\r\\n      contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to\\r\\n      restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her\\r\\n      mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely\\r\\n      insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane\\r\\n      in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;\\r\\n      but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what\\r\\n      chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\\r\\n      irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always\\r\\n      affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,\\r\\n      would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and\\r\\n      vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt\\r\\n      with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they\\r\\n      would be going there forever.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy’s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good\\r\\n      opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His\\r\\n      affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct\\r\\n      cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness\\r\\n      of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the\\r\\n      thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so\\r\\n      replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been\\r\\n      deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\r\\n\\r\\n      When to these recollections was added the development of\\r\\n      Wickham’s character, it may be easily believed that the happy\\r\\n      spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much\\r\\n      affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear\\r\\n      tolerably cheerful.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\\r\\n      week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening\\r\\n      was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into\\r\\n      the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the\\r\\n      best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of\\r\\n      placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself\\r\\n      obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and\\r\\n      pack her trunk afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\\r\\n      wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford\\r\\n      again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to\\r\\n      curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 38\\r\\n\\r\\n      On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a\\r\\n      few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the\\r\\n      opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed\\r\\n      indispensably necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has\\r\\n      yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I\\r\\n      am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving\\r\\n      her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt,\\r\\n      I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our\\r\\n      humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few\\r\\n      domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford\\r\\n      extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will\\r\\n      believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done\\r\\n      everything in our power to prevent your spending your time\\r\\n      unpleasantly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.\\r\\n      She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of\\r\\n      being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received,\\r\\n      must make _her_ feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and\\r\\n      with a more smiling solemnity replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\r\\n      time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most\\r\\n      fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very\\r\\n      superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the\\r\\n      frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may\\r\\n      flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been\\r\\n      entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s\\r\\n      family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing\\r\\n      which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see\\r\\n      how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge\\r\\n      that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I\\r\\n      should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion,\\r\\n      while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he\\r\\n      was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to\\r\\n      unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\r\\n      Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you\\r\\n      will be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs.\\r\\n      Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust\\r\\n      it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but\\r\\n      on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure\\r\\n      you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most\\r\\n      cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte\\r\\n      and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in\\r\\n      everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas\\r\\n      between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where\\r\\n      that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she\\r\\n      firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was\\r\\n      not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by\\r\\n      the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy\\r\\n      to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes\\r\\n      open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to\\r\\n      go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her\\r\\n      housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent\\r\\n      concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\\r\\n      parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After\\r\\n      an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was\\r\\n      attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down\\r\\n      the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all\\r\\n      her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had\\r\\n      received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr.\\r\\n      and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria\\r\\n      followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he\\r\\n      suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\\r\\n      hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at\\r\\n      Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble\\r\\n      respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their\\r\\n      kindness to you while you have been here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be\\r\\n      shut, and the carriage drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it\\r\\n      seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many\\r\\n      things have happened!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\\r\\n      twice! How much I shall have to tell!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to\\r\\n      conceal!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any\\r\\n      alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they\\r\\n      reached Mr. Gardiner’s house, where they were to remain a few\\r\\n      days.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of\\r\\n      studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the\\r\\n      kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go\\r\\n      home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for\\r\\n      observation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even\\r\\n      for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s\\r\\n      proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would\\r\\n      so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so\\r\\n      highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been\\r\\n      able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing\\r\\n      could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she\\r\\n      remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her\\r\\n      fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\\r\\n      repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister\\r\\n      further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 39\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies\\r\\n      set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.\\r\\n      Bennet’s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in\\r\\n      token of the coachman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking\\r\\n      out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an\\r\\n      hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite\\r\\n      milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad\\r\\n      and cucumber.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a\\r\\n      table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually\\r\\n      affords, exclaiming, “Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable\\r\\n      surprise?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend\\r\\n      us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.”\\r\\n      Then, showing her purchases—“Look here, I have bought this\\r\\n      bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might\\r\\n      as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get\\r\\n      home, and see if I can make it up any better.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\r\\n      unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the\\r\\n      shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim\\r\\n      it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it\\r\\n      will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the\\r\\n      ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest\\r\\n      satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want\\r\\n      papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a\\r\\n      delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at\\r\\n      all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a\\r\\n      miserable summer else we shall have!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be a delightful scheme\\r\\n      indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton,\\r\\n      and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset\\r\\n      already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of\\r\\n      Meryton!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down\\r\\n      at table. “What do you think? It is excellent news—capital\\r\\n      news—and about a certain person we all like!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told\\r\\n      he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You\\r\\n      thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he\\r\\n      often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is\\r\\n      an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long\\r\\n      chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear\\r\\n      Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger\\r\\n      of Wickham’s marrying Mary King. There’s for you! She is gone\\r\\n      down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection\\r\\n      imprudent as to fortune.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said\\r\\n      Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never\\r\\n      cared three straws about her—who _could_ about such a nasty\\r\\n      little freckled thing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\r\\n      coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the\\r\\n      _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had harboured\\r\\n      and fancied liberal!\\r\\n\\r\\n      As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\r\\n      ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all\\r\\n      their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition\\r\\n      of Kitty’s and Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I\\r\\n      bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another\\r\\n      bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk\\r\\n      and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear\\r\\n      what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen\\r\\n      any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes\\r\\n      that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.\\r\\n      Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost\\r\\n      three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being\\r\\n      married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to\\r\\n      get husbands, you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have\\r\\n      taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any\\r\\n      fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of\\r\\n      you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear\\r\\n      me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel\\r\\n      Forster’s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.\\r\\n      Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the\\r\\n      bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked\\r\\n      the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was\\r\\n      forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\\r\\n      dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes on purpose to pass for\\r\\n      a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel\\r\\n      and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were\\r\\n      forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how\\r\\n      well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or\\r\\n      three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the\\r\\n      least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I\\r\\n      should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and\\r\\n      then they soon found out what was the matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\r\\n      Lydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to\\r\\n      amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened\\r\\n      as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent\\r\\n      mention of Wickham’s name.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to\\r\\n      see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner\\r\\n      did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\\r\\n      Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were\\r\\n      the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was enquiring of\\r\\n      Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of\\r\\n      the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and,\\r\\n      on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and\\r\\n      Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s, was\\r\\n      enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who\\r\\n      would hear her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had\\r\\n      such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and\\r\\n      pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone\\r\\n      so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to\\r\\n      the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated\\r\\n      the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and\\r\\n      if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then\\r\\n      when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have\\r\\n      got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we\\r\\n      were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,\\r\\n      that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear\\r\\n      sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be\\r\\n      congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they\\r\\n      would have no charms for _me_—I should infinitely prefer a book.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\\r\\n      anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary\\r\\n      at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to\\r\\n      walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth\\r\\n      steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss\\r\\n      Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in\\r\\n      pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her\\r\\n      opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was\\r\\n      resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_ of\\r\\n      the regiment’s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.\\r\\n      In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone, she hoped there\\r\\n      could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had not been many hours at home before she found that the\\r\\n      Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn,\\r\\n      was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw\\r\\n      directly that her father had not the smallest intention of\\r\\n      yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and\\r\\n      equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never\\r\\n      yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 40\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\\r\\n      could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress\\r\\n      every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing\\r\\n      her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the\\r\\n      chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong\\r\\n      sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear\\r\\n      perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other\\r\\n      feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his\\r\\n      sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but\\r\\n      still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s\\r\\n      refusal must have given him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and\\r\\n      certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it\\r\\n      must increase his disappointment!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he\\r\\n      has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his\\r\\n      regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Blame you! Oh, no.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very\\r\\n      next day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents\\r\\n      as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this\\r\\n      for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world\\r\\n      without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole\\r\\n      race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was\\r\\n      Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of\\r\\n      consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour\\r\\n      to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one\\r\\n      without involving the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to\\r\\n      make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you\\r\\n      must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of\\r\\n      merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and\\r\\n      of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am\\r\\n      inclined to believe it all Darcy’s; but you shall do as you\\r\\n      choose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from\\r\\n      Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham\\r\\n      so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear\\r\\n      Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a\\r\\n      disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!\\r\\n      and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too\\r\\n      distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you\\r\\n      so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that\\r\\n      I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your\\r\\n      profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much\\r\\n      longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\r\\n      countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of\\r\\n      those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other\\r\\n      all the appearance of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it\\r\\n      as you used to do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a\\r\\n      dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s\\r\\n      genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\r\\n      One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but\\r\\n      one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then\\r\\n      stumbling on something witty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not\\r\\n      treat the matter as you do now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say\\r\\n      unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane\\r\\n      to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain\\r\\n      and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong\\r\\n      expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they\\r\\n      _do_ appear wholly undeserved.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a\\r\\n      most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\\r\\n      encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I\\r\\n      want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our\\r\\n      acquaintances in general understand Wickham’s character.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can\\r\\n      be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your\\r\\n      opinion?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised\\r\\n      me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every\\r\\n      particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as\\r\\n      possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to\\r\\n      the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general\\r\\n      prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the\\r\\n      death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him\\r\\n      in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be\\r\\n      gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he\\r\\n      really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we\\r\\n      may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present\\r\\n      I will say nothing about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin\\r\\n      him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and\\r\\n      anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him\\r\\n      desperate.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\r\\n      She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her\\r\\n      for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,\\r\\n      whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was\\r\\n      still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the\\r\\n      disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s\\r\\n      letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been\\r\\n      valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could\\r\\n      partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\\r\\n      understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing\\r\\n      off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if\\r\\n      that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely\\r\\n      be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable\\r\\n      manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till\\r\\n      it has lost all its value!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\\r\\n      real state of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still\\r\\n      cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even\\r\\n      fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of\\r\\n      first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater\\r\\n      steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so\\r\\n      fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every\\r\\n      other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\r\\n      feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence\\r\\n      of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health\\r\\n      and their tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion\\r\\n      _now_ of this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am\\r\\n      determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my\\r\\n      sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane\\r\\n      saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving\\r\\n      young man—and I do not suppose there’s the least chance in the\\r\\n      world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming\\r\\n      to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of\\r\\n      everybody, too, who is likely to know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come.\\r\\n      Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and\\r\\n      if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort\\r\\n      is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will\\r\\n      be sorry for what he has done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\\r\\n      expectation, she made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the\\r\\n      Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope\\r\\n      it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is\\r\\n      an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her\\r\\n      mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in\\r\\n      _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, nothing at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes.\\r\\n      _They_ will take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will\\r\\n      never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!\\r\\n      And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your\\r\\n      father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say,\\r\\n      whenever that happens.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt\\r\\n      they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be\\r\\n      easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the\\r\\n      better. _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only\\r\\n      entailed on me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 41\\r\\n\\r\\n      The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.\\r\\n      It was the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the\\r\\n      young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The\\r\\n      dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were\\r\\n      still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course\\r\\n      of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for\\r\\n      this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was\\r\\n      extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in\\r\\n      any of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would\\r\\n      they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be\\r\\n      smiling so, Lizzy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\\r\\n      what she had herself endured on a similar occasion,\\r\\n      five-and-twenty years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when\\r\\n      Colonel Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have\\r\\n      broken my heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\\r\\n      disagreeable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of\\r\\n      good,” added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\\r\\n      Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all\\r\\n      sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy’s objections; and never had she been so much disposed\\r\\n      to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\\r\\n      she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the\\r\\n      colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This\\r\\n      invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately\\r\\n      married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had\\r\\n      recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_\\r\\n      months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\r\\n      Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of\\r\\n      Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her\\r\\n      sister’s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless\\r\\n      ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratulations, and laughing and\\r\\n      talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty\\r\\n      continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as\\r\\n      unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as\\r\\n      Lydia,” said she, “Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I\\r\\n      have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for\\r\\n      I am two years older.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to\\r\\n      make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was\\r\\n      so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother\\r\\n      and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all\\r\\n      possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as\\r\\n      such a step must make her were it known, she could not help\\r\\n      secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented\\r\\n      to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general behaviour, the\\r\\n      little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a\\r\\n      woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\r\\n      imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the\\r\\n      temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her\\r\\n      attentively, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\\r\\n      public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with\\r\\n      so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the\\r\\n      present circumstances.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great\\r\\n      disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of\\r\\n      Lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already\\r\\n      arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the\\r\\n      affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened\\r\\n      away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast\\r\\n      down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a\\r\\n      little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the\\r\\n      list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s\\r\\n      folly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It\\r\\n      is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now\\r\\n      complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must\\r\\n      be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of\\r\\n      all restraint which mark Lydia’s character. Excuse me, for I must\\r\\n      speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble\\r\\n      of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her\\r\\n      present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will\\r\\n      soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be\\r\\n      fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\r\\n      that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in\\r\\n      the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any\\r\\n      attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the\\r\\n      ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off\\r\\n      any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for\\r\\n      admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is\\r\\n      comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\\r\\n      ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father,\\r\\n      can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and\\r\\n      despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not\\r\\n      be often involved in the disgrace?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\r\\n      affectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are\\r\\n      known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear\\r\\n      to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very\\r\\n      silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does\\r\\n      not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a\\r\\n      sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she\\r\\n      is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At\\r\\n      Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt\\r\\n      than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth\\r\\n      their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may\\r\\n      teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\\r\\n      many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the\\r\\n      rest of her life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own\\r\\n      opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and\\r\\n      sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her\\r\\n      vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having\\r\\n      performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or\\r\\n      augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference\\r\\n      with her father, their indignation would hardly have found\\r\\n      expression in their united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a\\r\\n      visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly\\r\\n      happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets\\r\\n      of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself\\r\\n      the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present\\r\\n      unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched\\r\\n      forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\\r\\n      and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the\\r\\n      view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting\\r\\n      with at least six officers at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\\r\\n      and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?\\r\\n      They could have been understood only by her mother, who might\\r\\n      have felt nearly the same. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that\\r\\n      consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband’s never\\r\\n      intending to go there himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their\\r\\n      raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of\\r\\n      Lydia’s leaving home.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having\\r\\n      been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation\\r\\n      was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality\\r\\n      entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very\\r\\n      gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a\\r\\n      sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to\\r\\n      herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the\\r\\n      inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\r\\n      had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,\\r\\n      after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern\\r\\n      for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such\\r\\n      idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed\\r\\n      it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing,\\r\\n      that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had\\r\\n      been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference\\r\\n      secured at any time by their renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he\\r\\n      dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little\\r\\n      was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on\\r\\n      his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had\\r\\n      passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him,\\r\\n      if he was acquainted with the former.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s\\r\\n      recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly\\r\\n      seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very\\r\\n      gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer\\r\\n      was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon\\r\\n      afterwards added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How long did you say he was at Rosings?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Nearly three weeks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And you saw him frequently?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, almost every day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\\r\\n      acquaintance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.\\r\\n      “And pray, may I ask?—” But checking himself, he added, in a\\r\\n      gayer tone, “Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to\\r\\n      add aught of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not\\r\\n      hope,” he continued in a lower and more serious tone, “that he is\\r\\n      improved in essentials.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very\\r\\n      much what he ever was.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\\r\\n      rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\\r\\n      something in her countenance which made him listen with an\\r\\n      apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\\r\\n      that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but\\r\\n      that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better\\r\\n      understood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\\r\\n      agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off\\r\\n      his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the\\r\\n      gentlest of accents:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\\r\\n      comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to\\r\\n      assume even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that\\r\\n      direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others,\\r\\n      for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have\\r\\n      suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which\\r\\n      you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his\\r\\n      visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands\\r\\n      much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when\\r\\n      they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish\\r\\n      of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain\\r\\n      he has very much at heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered\\r\\n      only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted\\r\\n      to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was\\r\\n      in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with\\r\\n      the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no\\r\\n      further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last\\r\\n      with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never\\r\\n      meeting again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\\r\\n      Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.\\r\\n      The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than\\r\\n      pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep\\r\\n      from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good\\r\\n      wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her\\r\\n      injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying\\r\\n      herself as much as possible—advice which there was every reason\\r\\n      to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous\\r\\n      happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle\\r\\n      adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 42\\r\\n\\r\\n      Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\\r\\n      could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal\\r\\n      felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and\\r\\n      beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty\\r\\n      generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and\\r\\n      illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all\\r\\n      real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had\\r\\n      vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were\\r\\n      overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek\\r\\n      comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had\\r\\n      brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the\\r\\n      unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the\\r\\n      country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his\\r\\n      principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise\\r\\n      indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his\\r\\n      amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in\\r\\n      general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of\\r\\n      entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive\\r\\n      benefit from such as are given.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of\\r\\n      her father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with\\r\\n      pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his\\r\\n      affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what\\r\\n      she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that\\r\\n      continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in\\r\\n      exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so\\r\\n      highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now\\r\\n      the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable\\r\\n      a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\\r\\n      from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which,\\r\\n      rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of\\r\\n      his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his\\r\\n      wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure she found\\r\\n      little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.\\r\\n      Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home\\r\\n      she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the\\r\\n      dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their\\r\\n      domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her\\r\\n      natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were\\r\\n      removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil\\r\\n      might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly\\r\\n      and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\r\\n      watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found,\\r\\n      what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she\\r\\n      had looked forward with impatient desire did not, in taking\\r\\n      place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It\\r\\n      was consequently necessary to name some other period for the\\r\\n      commencement of actual felicity—to have some other point on which\\r\\n      her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the\\r\\n      pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and\\r\\n      prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now\\r\\n      the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\\r\\n      for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her\\r\\n      mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included\\r\\n      Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to\\r\\n      wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment\\r\\n      would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless\\r\\n      source of regret in my sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to\\r\\n      have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which\\r\\n      every part promises delight can never be successful; and general\\r\\n      disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little\\r\\n      peculiar vexation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very\\r\\n      minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always\\r\\n      long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother\\r\\n      contained little else than that they were just returned from the\\r\\n      library, where such and such officers had attended them, and\\r\\n      where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite\\r\\n      wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would\\r\\n      have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\\r\\n      violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going\\r\\n      off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister,\\r\\n      there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty,\\r\\n      though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words\\r\\n      to be made public.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\r\\n      good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\r\\n      Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in\\r\\n      town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer\\r\\n      engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual\\r\\n      querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much\\r\\n      recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event\\r\\n      of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the\\r\\n      following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not\\r\\n      to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and\\r\\n      malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should\\r\\n      be quartered in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\\r\\n      fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a\\r\\n      letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its\\r\\n      commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be\\r\\n      prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in\\r\\n      July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that\\r\\n      left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as\\r\\n      they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and\\r\\n      comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the\\r\\n      Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to\\r\\n      the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than\\r\\n      Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy\\r\\n      the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a\\r\\n      peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly\\r\\n      passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a\\r\\n      few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all\\r\\n      the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the\\r\\n      Peak.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\\r\\n      seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time\\r\\n      enough. But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her\\r\\n      temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.\\r\\n      It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of\\r\\n      Pemberley and its owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his\\r\\n      county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without\\r\\n      his perceiving me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to\\r\\n      pass away before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass\\r\\n      away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at\\r\\n      length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and\\r\\n      eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the\\r\\n      particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general\\r\\n      favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly\\r\\n      adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them,\\r\\n      playing with them, and loving them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\\r\\n      next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\\r\\n      One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a\\r\\n      suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\\r\\n      inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and\\r\\n      affection and intelligence, which might supply it among\\r\\n      themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It is not the object of this work to give a description of\\r\\n      Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which\\r\\n      their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,\\r\\n      Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of\\r\\n      Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of\\r\\n      Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s former residence, and where\\r\\n      she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they\\r\\n      bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of\\r\\n      the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found\\r\\n      from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their\\r\\n      direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking\\r\\n      over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\\r\\n      inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\\r\\n      willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\\r\\n      heard so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many\\r\\n      of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth\\r\\n      there, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\\r\\n      Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\\r\\n      it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\\r\\n      going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\\r\\n      satin curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine\\r\\n      house richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it\\r\\n      myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the\\r\\n      finest woods in the country.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The\\r\\n      possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\\r\\n      instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very\\r\\n      idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt\\r\\n      than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;\\r\\n      and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if\\r\\n      her private enquiries to the absence of the family were\\r\\n      unfavourably answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\\r\\n      whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name\\r\\n      of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family\\r\\n      were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the\\r\\n      last question—and her alarms now being removed, she was at\\r\\n      leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house\\r\\n      herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and\\r\\n      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper\\r\\n      air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the\\r\\n      scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 43\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\\r\\n      of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length\\r\\n      they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\r\\n      They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\\r\\n      time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\\r\\n      admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually\\r\\n      ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of\\r\\n      a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was\\r\\n      instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite\\r\\n      side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.\\r\\n      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising\\r\\n      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,\\r\\n      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but\\r\\n      without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal\\r\\n      nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen\\r\\n      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty\\r\\n      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\\r\\n      all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt\\r\\n      that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\r\\n\\r\\n      They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\\r\\n      door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all\\r\\n      her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest\\r\\n      the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,\\r\\n      they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited\\r\\n      for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she\\r\\n      was.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much\\r\\n      less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding\\r\\n      her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,\\r\\n      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after\\r\\n      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.\\r\\n      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving\\r\\n      increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.\\r\\n      Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the\\r\\n      whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the\\r\\n      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with\\r\\n      delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were\\r\\n      taking different positions; but from every window there were\\r\\n      beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their\\r\\n      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but\\r\\n      Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither\\r\\n      gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real\\r\\n      elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress!\\r\\n      With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\r\\n      Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in\\r\\n      them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and\\r\\n      aunt. But no,”—recollecting herself—“that could never be; my\\r\\n      uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been\\r\\n      allowed to invite them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very\\r\\n      like regret.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was\\r\\n      really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,\\r\\n      the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with\\r\\n      alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we\\r\\n      expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.” How\\r\\n      rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any\\r\\n      circumstance been delayed a day!\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and\\r\\n      saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\\r\\n      miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly,\\r\\n      how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it\\r\\n      was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s\\r\\n      steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He\\r\\n      is now gone into the army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has\\r\\n      turned out very wild.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth\\r\\n      could not return it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\\r\\n      miniatures, “is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the\\r\\n      same time as the other—about eight years ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner, looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But,\\r\\n      Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\r\\n      intimation of her knowing her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, very handsome.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up\\r\\n      stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\r\\n      This room was my late master’s favourite room, and these\\r\\n      miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of\\r\\n      them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,\\r\\n      drawn when she was only eight years old.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\\r\\n      accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room\\r\\n      is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my\\r\\n      master; she comes here to-morrow with him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,\\r\\n      encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks;\\r\\n      Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great\\r\\n      pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend\\r\\n      half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer\\r\\n      months.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know\\r\\n      who is good enough for him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,\\r\\n      “It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think\\r\\n      so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows\\r\\n      him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty\\r\\n      far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the\\r\\n      housekeeper added, “I have never known a cross word from him in\\r\\n      my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\\r\\n      to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her\\r\\n      firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed\\r\\n      to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are\\r\\n      lucky in having such a master.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I\\r\\n      could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that\\r\\n      they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when\\r\\n      they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most\\r\\n      generous-hearted boy in the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought\\r\\n      she.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like\\r\\n      him—just as affable to the poor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\\r\\n      more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She\\r\\n      related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the\\r\\n      rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\n      highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he\\r\\n      attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led\\r\\n      again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many\\r\\n      merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that\\r\\n      ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of\\r\\n      nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or\\r\\n      servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him\\r\\n      proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it\\r\\n      is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked,\\r\\n      “is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perhaps we might be deceived.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very\\r\\n      pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and\\r\\n      lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it\\r\\n      was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a\\r\\n      liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked\\r\\n      towards one of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should\\r\\n      enter the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added.\\r\\n      “Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in\\r\\n      a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\\r\\n      were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good\\r\\n      paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such\\r\\n      as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to\\r\\n      look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects\\r\\n      were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could\\r\\n      have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked\\r\\n      in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\r\\n      At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to\\r\\n      have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several\\r\\n      minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and\\r\\n      returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs.\\r\\n      Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father’s\\r\\n      lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\n      There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more\\r\\n      gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\\r\\n      the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on\\r\\n      him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is\\r\\n      more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a\\r\\n      brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s\\r\\n      happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain\\r\\n      was it in his power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be\\r\\n      done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the\\r\\n      housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood\\r\\n      before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes\\r\\n      upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment\\r\\n      of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its\\r\\n      warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When all of the house that was open to general inspection had\\r\\n      been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\\r\\n      housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at\\r\\n      the hall-door.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\\r\\n      turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\\r\\n      while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\\r\\n      the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\\r\\n      which led behind it to the stables.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\\r\\n      his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their\\r\\n      eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\\r\\n      the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed\\r\\n      immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced\\r\\n      towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of\\r\\n      perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\r\\n      received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\\r\\n      overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the\\r\\n      picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure\\r\\n      the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s\\r\\n      expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately\\r\\n      have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to\\r\\n      their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift\\r\\n      her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to\\r\\n      his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of\\r\\n      his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered\\r\\n      was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\\r\\n      impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the\\r\\n      few minutes in which they continued were some of the most\\r\\n      uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;\\r\\n      when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and\\r\\n      he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left\\r\\n      Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so\\r\\n      hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\\r\\n      few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\\r\\n      himself, and took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\\r\\n      figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by\\r\\n      her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered\\r\\n      by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,\\r\\n      the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must\\r\\n      appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so\\r\\n      vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself\\r\\n      in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come\\r\\n      a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\\r\\n      sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\\r\\n      discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment\\r\\n      arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She\\r\\n      blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And\\r\\n      his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he\\r\\n      should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such\\r\\n      civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she\\r\\n      seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with\\r\\n      such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast\\r\\n      did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his\\r\\n      letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\\r\\n      account for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\\r\\n      and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a\\r\\n      finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it\\r\\n      was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\\r\\n      though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her\\r\\n      uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as\\r\\n      they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her\\r\\n      thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,\\r\\n      whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to\\r\\n      know what at the moment was passing in his mind—in what manner he\\r\\n      thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was\\r\\n      still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt\\r\\n      himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\\r\\n      not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\\r\\n      seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her\\r\\n      with composure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence\\r\\n      of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more\\r\\n      like herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\\r\\n      while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where\\r\\n      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many\\r\\n      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long\\r\\n      range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the\\r\\n      stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole\\r\\n      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant\\r\\n      smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the\\r\\n      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought\\r\\n      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to\\r\\n      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They\\r\\n      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air\\r\\n      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet\\r\\n      visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed\\r\\n      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough\\r\\n      coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its\\r\\n      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived\\r\\n      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great\\r\\n      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the\\r\\n      carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\\r\\n      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on\\r\\n      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but\\r\\n      their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to\\r\\n      indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much\\r\\n      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in\\r\\n      the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced\\r\\n      but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were\\r\\n      again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to\\r\\n      what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching\\r\\n      them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\\r\\n      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\r\\n      they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\\r\\n      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and\\r\\n      to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a\\r\\n      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into\\r\\n      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk\\r\\n      concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was\\r\\n      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost\\r\\n      none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she\\r\\n      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she\\r\\n      had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when\\r\\n      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise\\r\\n      of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her\\r\\n      colour changed, and she said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\\r\\n      he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to\\r\\n      her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was\\r\\n      quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\\r\\n      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people\\r\\n      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.\\r\\n      “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they\\r\\n      are? He takes them now for people of fashion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named\\r\\n      their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to\\r\\n      see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his\\r\\n      decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.\\r\\n      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he\\r\\n      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going\\r\\n      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but\\r\\n      triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\\r\\n      relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\\r\\n      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\\r\\n      expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his\\r\\n      intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as\\r\\n      often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,\\r\\n      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and\\r\\n      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually\\r\\n      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\\r\\n      Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said\\r\\n      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be\\r\\n      all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\\r\\n      continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what\\r\\n      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_—it cannot be for _my_ sake\\r\\n      that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could\\r\\n      not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should\\r\\n      still love me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\\r\\n      two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending\\r\\n      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some\\r\\n      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It\\r\\n      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the\\r\\n      morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and\\r\\n      consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by\\r\\n      her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,\\r\\n      the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been\\r\\n      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and\\r\\n      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very\\r\\n      unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\\r\\n      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,\\r\\n      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not\\r\\n      immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth\\r\\n      of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned\\r\\n      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\\r\\n      whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,”\\r\\n      he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an\\r\\n      acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were\\r\\n      instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had\\r\\n      been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by\\r\\n      his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after\\r\\n      a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will\\r\\n      you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to\\r\\n      your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\\r\\n      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She\\r\\n      immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\\r\\n      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\\r\\n      without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying\\r\\n      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of\\r\\n      her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\r\\n      Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\\r\\n      flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her\\r\\n      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\\r\\n      others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself\\r\\n      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time\\r\\n      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She\\r\\n      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every\\r\\n      subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,\\r\\n      and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.\\r\\n      Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas\\r\\n      were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go\\r\\n      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,\\r\\n      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,\\r\\n      Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\\r\\n      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\\r\\n      had expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\\r\\n      unassuming,” said her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,”\\r\\n      replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not\\r\\n      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some\\r\\n      people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was\\r\\n      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\\r\\n      necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was\\r\\n      very trifling.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as\\r\\n      Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his\\r\\n      features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he\\r\\n      was so disagreeable?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\\r\\n      liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\\r\\n      she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,”\\r\\n      replied her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I\\r\\n      shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\\r\\n      another day, and warn me off his grounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his\\r\\n      character, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I\\r\\n      really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\\r\\n      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not\\r\\n      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing\\r\\n      about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity\\r\\n      in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea\\r\\n      of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his\\r\\n      house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help\\r\\n      laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,\\r\\n      and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\\r\\n      vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them\\r\\n      to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what\\r\\n      she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were\\r\\n      capable of a very different construction; and that his character\\r\\n      was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had\\r\\n      been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she\\r\\n      related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in\\r\\n      which they had been connected, without actually naming her\\r\\n      authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\\r\\n      approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave\\r\\n      way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in\\r\\n      pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its\\r\\n      environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by\\r\\n      the morning’s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off\\r\\n      again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was\\r\\n      spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many\\r\\n      years’ discontinuance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave\\r\\n      Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she\\r\\n      could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s\\r\\n      civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted\\r\\n      with his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 44\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to\\r\\n      visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was\\r\\n      consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole\\r\\n      of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very\\r\\n      morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They\\r\\n      had been walking about the place with some of their new friends,\\r\\n      and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining\\r\\n      with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a\\r\\n      window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving\\r\\n      up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery,\\r\\n      guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\\r\\n      surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour\\r\\n      which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and\\r\\n      the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the\\r\\n      circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the\\r\\n      preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing\\r\\n      had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no\\r\\n      other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter\\r\\n      than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\\r\\n      newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation\\r\\n      of Elizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was\\r\\n      quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of\\r\\n      disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should\\r\\n      have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious\\r\\n      to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing\\r\\n      would fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\\r\\n      walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw\\r\\n      such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made\\r\\n      everything worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\\r\\n      introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that\\r\\n      her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.\\r\\n      Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was\\r\\n      exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes\\r\\n      convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it\\r\\n      difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\\r\\n      though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\\r\\n      appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her\\r\\n      brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her\\r\\n      manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had\\r\\n      expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as\\r\\n      ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such\\r\\n      different feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\\r\\n      Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\\r\\n      to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\\r\\n      Bingley’s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\\r\\n      entered the room. All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long\\r\\n      done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood\\r\\n      its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\\r\\n      expressed himself on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly,\\r\\n      though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\\r\\n      the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\\r\\n      personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The\\r\\n      whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The\\r\\n      suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece\\r\\n      directed their observation towards each with an earnest though\\r\\n      guarded enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full\\r\\n      conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of\\r\\n      the lady’s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that\\r\\n      the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain\\r\\n      the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her\\r\\n      own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter\\r\\n      object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of\\r\\n      success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were\\r\\n      prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was\\r\\n      eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;\\r\\n      and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his\\r\\n      were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he\\r\\n      talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\\r\\n      herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying\\r\\n      to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she\\r\\n      could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had\\r\\n      been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side\\r\\n      that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that\\r\\n      could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon\\r\\n      satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere\\r\\n      they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\\r\\n      recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\\r\\n      saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.\\r\\n      He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking\\r\\n      together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that\\r\\n      it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing\\r\\n      her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight\\r\\n      months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were\\r\\n      all dancing together at Netherfield.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\\r\\n      afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of\\r\\n      the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was\\r\\n      not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there\\r\\n      was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\\r\\n      expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\\r\\n      heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his\\r\\n      companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners\\r\\n      which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence\\r\\n      might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus\\r\\n      seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people\\r\\n      with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\\r\\n      disgrace—when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to\\r\\n      the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\\r\\n      their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the\\r\\n      change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she\\r\\n      could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never,\\r\\n      even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his\\r\\n      dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to\\r\\n      please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as\\r\\n      now, when no importance could result from the success of his\\r\\n      endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his\\r\\n      attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and\\r\\n      censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they\\r\\n      arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in\\r\\n      expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss\\r\\n      Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.\\r\\n      Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in\\r\\n      the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner\\r\\n      looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the\\r\\n      invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance,\\r\\n      but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that\\r\\n      this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment\\r\\n      than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who\\r\\n      was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she\\r\\n      ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next\\r\\n      was fixed on.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\\r\\n      Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and\\r\\n      many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.\\r\\n      Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak\\r\\n      of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some\\r\\n      others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of\\r\\n      considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though\\r\\n      while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager\\r\\n      to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and\\r\\n      aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\\r\\n      favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity;\\r\\n      it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident\\r\\n      that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had\\r\\n      before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love\\r\\n      with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify\\r\\n      enquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,\\r\\n      as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\r\\n      They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn\\r\\n      his character from their own feelings and his servant’s report,\\r\\n      without any reference to any other account, the circle in\\r\\n      Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it\\r\\n      for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing\\r\\n      the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority\\r\\n      of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and\\r\\n      whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily\\r\\n      rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\\r\\n      their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.\\r\\n      They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably\\r\\n      had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants\\r\\n      of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was\\r\\n      acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much\\r\\n      good among the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was\\r\\n      not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his\\r\\n      concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood,\\r\\n      it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he\\r\\n      had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards\\r\\n      discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening\\r\\n      more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it\\r\\n      seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings\\r\\n      towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours\\r\\n      endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him.\\r\\n      No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been\\r\\n      ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so\\r\\n      called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable\\r\\n      qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\\r\\n      time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now\\r\\n      heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony\\r\\n      so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in\\r\\n      so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,\\r\\n      above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of\\r\\n      goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;\\r\\n      gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving\\r\\n      her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony\\r\\n      of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\\r\\n      accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would\\r\\n      avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental\\r\\n      meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any\\r\\n      indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where\\r\\n      their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\\r\\n      opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his\\r\\n      sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only\\r\\n      astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be\\r\\n      attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be\\r\\n      encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\\r\\n      exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to\\r\\n      him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted\\r\\n      to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself,\\r\\n      and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should\\r\\n      employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed,\\r\\n      of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the\\r\\n      niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s in coming to\\r\\n      see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had\\r\\n      reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though\\r\\n      it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their\\r\\n      side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to\\r\\n      wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were,\\r\\n      therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked\\r\\n      herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme\\r\\n      had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made\\r\\n      of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 45\\r\\n\\r\\n      Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her\\r\\n      had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\\r\\n      unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was\\r\\n      curious to know with how much civility on that lady’s side the\\r\\n      acquaintance would now be renewed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the\\r\\n      saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.\\r\\n      Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing\\r\\n      view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the\\r\\n      beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over\\r\\n      the intermediate lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting\\r\\n      there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom\\r\\n      she lived in London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very\\r\\n      civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though\\r\\n      proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily\\r\\n      give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her\\r\\n      being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however,\\r\\n      did her justice, and pitied her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\\r\\n      curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\\r\\n      pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first\\r\\n      broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman,\\r\\n      whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to\\r\\n      be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between\\r\\n      her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the\\r\\n      conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished\\r\\n      for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\\r\\n      short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\\r\\n      Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\\r\\n      Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not\\r\\n      have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they\\r\\n      not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not\\r\\n      sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts\\r\\n      were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the\\r\\n      gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the\\r\\n      master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished\\r\\n      or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in\\r\\n      this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley’s\\r\\n      voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry\\r\\n      after the health of her family. She answered with equal\\r\\n      indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\\r\\n      entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all\\r\\n      the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till\\r\\n      after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to\\r\\n      Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was\\r\\n      now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all\\r\\n      talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,\\r\\n      nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n      While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\\r\\n      whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\\r\\n      and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes\\r\\n      to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three\\r\\n      other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had\\r\\n      left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended\\r\\n      a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than\\r\\n      Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;\\r\\n      a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the\\r\\n      more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the\\r\\n      whole party were awakened against them, and that there was\\r\\n      scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first\\r\\n      came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so\\r\\n      strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the smiles\\r\\n      which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\\r\\n      objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her\\r\\n      attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her\\r\\n      brother’s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and\\r\\n      Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to\\r\\n      get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt\\r\\n      at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this\\r\\n      likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first\\r\\n      opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from\\r\\n      Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name; but\\r\\n      Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her\\r\\n      thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave\\r\\n      her a moment’s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel\\r\\n      the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a\\r\\n      tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance\\r\\n      showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking\\r\\n      at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to\\r\\n      lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then\\r\\n      giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained\\r\\n      from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\\r\\n      Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she\\r\\n      believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which\\r\\n      might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the\\r\\n      latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of\\r\\n      her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had\\r\\n      ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no\\r\\n      creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except\\r\\n      to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections her brother was\\r\\n      particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which\\r\\n      Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\\r\\n      hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and\\r\\n      without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate\\r\\n      him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something\\r\\n      to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\\r\\n      emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not\\r\\n      approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,\\r\\n      though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother,\\r\\n      whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest\\r\\n      in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed\\r\\n      to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on\\r\\n      her more and more cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer\\r\\n      above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their\\r\\n      carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not\\r\\n      join her. Her brother’s recommendation was enough to ensure her\\r\\n      favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such\\r\\n      terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of\\r\\n      finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy\\r\\n      returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\\r\\n      him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,”\\r\\n      she cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\\r\\n      is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and\\r\\n      I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\\r\\n      contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other\\r\\n      alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\\r\\n      consequence of travelling in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never\\r\\n      could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion\\r\\n      has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her\\r\\n      nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her\\r\\n      teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for\\r\\n      her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never\\r\\n      see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish\\r\\n      look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there\\r\\n      is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this\\r\\n      was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people\\r\\n      are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat\\r\\n      nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely\\r\\n      silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak,\\r\\n      she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed\\r\\n      we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\\r\\n      particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\\r\\n      dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_ a beauty!—I should as soon call her\\r\\n      mother a wit.’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I\\r\\n      believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but\\r\\n      _that_ was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since\\r\\n      I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my\\r\\n      acquaintance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\\r\\n      satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\\r\\n      pain but herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred\\r\\n      during their visit, as they returned, except what had\\r\\n      particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of\\r\\n      everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who\\r\\n      had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister,\\r\\n      his friends, his house, his fruit—of everything but himself; yet\\r\\n      Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him,\\r\\n      and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s\\r\\n      beginning the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 46\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a\\r\\n      letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this\\r\\n      disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had\\r\\n      now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and\\r\\n      her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at\\r\\n      once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent\\r\\n      elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written\\r\\n      the direction remarkably ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and\\r\\n      her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off\\r\\n      by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had\\r\\n      been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of\\r\\n      all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the\\r\\n      country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day\\r\\n      later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important\\r\\n      intelligence. It was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\\r\\n      of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of\\r\\n      alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say\\r\\n      relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just\\r\\n      as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us\\r\\n      that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to\\r\\n      own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty,\\r\\n      however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very\\r\\n      sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to\\r\\n      hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\\r\\n      Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this\\r\\n      step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His\\r\\n      choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can\\r\\n      give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father\\r\\n      bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know\\r\\n      what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They\\r\\n      were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were\\r\\n      not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent\\r\\n      off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten\\r\\n      miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here\\r\\n      soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their\\r\\n      intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\\r\\n      mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I\\r\\n      hardly know what I have written.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\\r\\n      knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter\\r\\n      instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost\\r\\n      impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than\\r\\n      the conclusion of the first.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\\r\\n      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\\r\\n      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\\r\\n      for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\\r\\n      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\r\\n      Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia\\r\\n      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place,\\r\\n      for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to\\r\\n      Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton\\r\\n      the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s\\r\\n      short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were\\r\\n      going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing\\r\\n      his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia\\r\\n      at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking\\r\\n      the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did\\r\\n      trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering\\r\\n      that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the\\r\\n      chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this\\r\\n      is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not\\r\\n      what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side\\r\\n      London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing\\r\\n      them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and\\r\\n      Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to\\r\\n      pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,\\r\\n      and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to\\r\\n      his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one\\r\\n      can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very\\r\\n      great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think\\r\\n      so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for\\r\\n      them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first\\r\\n      plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young\\r\\n      woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\\r\\n      her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,\\r\\n      that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he\\r\\n      shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.\\r\\n      was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and\\r\\n      keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but\\r\\n      this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my\\r\\n      life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having\\r\\n      concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,\\r\\n      one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have\\r\\n      been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as\\r\\n      the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?\\r\\n      I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\\r\\n      inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have\\r\\n      just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I\\r\\n      cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as\\r\\n      possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\r\\n      afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\\r\\n      ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\\r\\n      Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I\\r\\n      am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him\\r\\n      to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel\\r\\n      Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In\\r\\n      such an exigence, my uncle’s advice and assistance would be\\r\\n      everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I\\r\\n      must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her\\r\\n      seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,\\r\\n      without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she\\r\\n      reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and\\r\\n      before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind\\r\\n      every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation, hastily\\r\\n      exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I\\r\\n      have not an instant to lose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\\r\\n      politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a\\r\\n      minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she\\r\\n      felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\r\\n      Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though\\r\\n      in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to\\r\\n      fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself,\\r\\n      and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to\\r\\n      leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and\\r\\n      commiseration, “Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could\\r\\n      take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you\\r\\n      one? You are very ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\r\\n      “There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only\\r\\n      distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from\\r\\n      Longbourn.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes\\r\\n      could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could\\r\\n      only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her\\r\\n      in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just\\r\\n      had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be\\r\\n      concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her\\r\\n      friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him\\r\\n      too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,\\r\\n      nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in\\r\\n      a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_ might have prevented it! _I_\\r\\n      who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it\\r\\n      only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his\\r\\n      character been known, this could not have happened. But it is\\r\\n      all—all too late now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved—shocked. But is it\\r\\n      certain—absolutely certain?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were\\r\\n      traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not\\r\\n      gone to Scotland.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\\r\\n      her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my\\r\\n      uncle’s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in\\r\\n      half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that\\r\\n      nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are\\r\\n      they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is\\r\\n      every way horrible!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I known\\r\\n      what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of\\r\\n      doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was\\r\\n      walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow\\r\\n      contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and\\r\\n      instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything _must_\\r\\n      sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of\\r\\n      the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but\\r\\n      the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to\\r\\n      her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the\\r\\n      contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\\r\\n      wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have\\r\\n      loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.\\r\\n      Lydia—the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all,\\r\\n      soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with\\r\\n      her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else;\\r\\n      and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a\\r\\n      sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a\\r\\n      manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise\\r\\n      restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been long desiring my\\r\\n      absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but\\r\\n      real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\\r\\n      could be either said or done on my part that might offer\\r\\n      consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with\\r\\n      vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\\r\\n      This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having\\r\\n      the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say\\r\\n      that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the\\r\\n      unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be\\r\\n      long.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow\\r\\n      for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was\\r\\n      at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her\\r\\n      relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that\\r\\n      they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality\\r\\n      as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she\\r\\n      threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their\\r\\n      acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at\\r\\n      the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted\\r\\n      its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its\\r\\n      termination.\\r\\n\\r\\n      If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor\\r\\n      faulty. But if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is\\r\\n      unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often\\r\\n      described as arising on a first interview with its object, and\\r\\n      even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in\\r\\n      her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the\\r\\n      latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill\\r\\n      success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less\\r\\n      interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\\r\\n      with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy\\r\\n      must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that\\r\\n      wretched business. Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had\\r\\n      she entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one\\r\\n      but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an\\r\\n      expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this\\r\\n      development. While the contents of the first letter remained in\\r\\n      her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham\\r\\n      should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for\\r\\n      money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\\r\\n      incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an\\r\\n      attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though\\r\\n      she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an\\r\\n      elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no\\r\\n      difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her\\r\\n      understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,\\r\\n      that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that\\r\\n      Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.\\r\\n      Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite,\\r\\n      as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections\\r\\n      had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The\\r\\n      mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a\\r\\n      girl—oh! how acutely did she now feel it!\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot\\r\\n      to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon\\r\\n      her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable\\r\\n      of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost\\r\\n      persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s\\r\\n      interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered\\r\\n      the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had\\r\\n      hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s account that\\r\\n      their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly\\r\\n      on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\\r\\n      summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the\\r\\n      postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though Lydia had\\r\\n      never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not\\r\\n      but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned\\r\\n      in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror,\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth,\\r\\n      though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude;\\r\\n      and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating\\r\\n      to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as\\r\\n      soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\\r\\n      us; was it so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\\r\\n      engagement. _That_ is all settled.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is all settled;” repeated the other, as she ran into her\\r\\n      room to prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to\\r\\n      disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her\\r\\n      in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth\\r\\n      been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that\\r\\n      all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but\\r\\n      she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst\\r\\n      the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at\\r\\n      Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour,\\r\\n      however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile\\r\\n      having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be\\r\\n      done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the\\r\\n      morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\\r\\n      have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to\\r\\n      Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 47\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle,\\r\\n      as they drove from the town; “and really, upon serious\\r\\n      consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\\r\\n      your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very\\r\\n      unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a\\r\\n      girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was\\r\\n      actually staying in his colonel’s family, that I am strongly\\r\\n      inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would\\r\\n      not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\\r\\n      regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His\\r\\n      temptation is not adequate to the risk!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\\r\\n      moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your\\r\\n      uncle’s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,\\r\\n      honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so\\r\\n      very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him\\r\\n      up, as to believe him capable of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\r\\n      neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so!\\r\\n      But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if\\r\\n      that had been the case?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute\\r\\n      proof that they are not gone to Scotland.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\\r\\n      such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be\\r\\n      found on the Barnet road.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there,\\r\\n      though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\\r\\n      purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\\r\\n      either side; and it might strike them that they could be more\\r\\n      economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than\\r\\n      in Scotland.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must\\r\\n      their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His\\r\\n      most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded\\r\\n      of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a\\r\\n      woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims\\r\\n      has Lydia—what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good\\r\\n      humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of\\r\\n      benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the\\r\\n      apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\\r\\n      dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I\\r\\n      know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But\\r\\n      as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.\\r\\n      Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from\\r\\n      my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and the little\\r\\n      attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in\\r\\n      his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little\\r\\n      about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\\r\\n      of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\\r\\n      marriage?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied\\r\\n      Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of\\r\\n      decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,\\r\\n      really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her\\r\\n      justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to\\r\\n      think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\\r\\n      twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and\\r\\n      vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most\\r\\n      idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in\\r\\n      her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton,\\r\\n      nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head.\\r\\n      She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and\\r\\n      talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it?\\r\\n      susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively\\r\\n      enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person\\r\\n      and address that can captivate a woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very\\r\\n      ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever\\r\\n      might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\\r\\n      such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane\\r\\n      knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that\\r\\n      he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has\\r\\n      neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful\\r\\n      as he is insinuating.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\\r\\n      curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the\\r\\n      other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\\r\\n      yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke\\r\\n      of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality\\r\\n      towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at\\r\\n      liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about\\r\\n      the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss\\r\\n      Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,\\r\\n      disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must\\r\\n      know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\\r\\n      her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what\\r\\n      you and Jane seem so well to understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and\\r\\n      saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\\r\\n      Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I\\r\\n      returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\\r\\n      fortnight’s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I\\r\\n      related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\\r\\n      knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\\r\\n      one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him\\r\\n      should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that\\r\\n      Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her\\r\\n      eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\\r\\n      in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such\\r\\n      a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was\\r\\n      far enough from my thoughts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason,\\r\\n      I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on\\r\\n      either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\\r\\n      must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\\r\\n      thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready\\r\\n      enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near\\r\\n      Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months;\\r\\n      but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention;\\r\\n      and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\\r\\n      wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the\\r\\n      regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her\\r\\n      favourites.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could\\r\\n      be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this\\r\\n      interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could\\r\\n      detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the\\r\\n      keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval\\r\\n      of ease or forgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\\r\\n      night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.\\r\\n      It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not\\r\\n      have been wearied by long expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\\r\\n      standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\\r\\n      and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\\r\\n      that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their\\r\\n      whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first\\r\\n      pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\\r\\n      kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\\r\\n      down from her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears\\r\\n      filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether\\r\\n      anything had been heard of the fugitives.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I\\r\\n      hope everything will be well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Is my father in town?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And have you heard from him often?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday\\r\\n      to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his\\r\\n      directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely\\r\\n      added that he should not write again till he had something of\\r\\n      importance to mention.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And my mother—how is she? How are you all?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\\r\\n      greatly shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction\\r\\n      in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary\\r\\n      and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But you—how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much\\r\\n      you must have gone through!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\\r\\n      their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to\\r\\n      by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and\\r\\n      aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles\\r\\n      and tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\\r\\n      Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\\r\\n      others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to\\r\\n      give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence\\r\\n      of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still\\r\\n      expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would\\r\\n      bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain\\r\\n      their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\\r\\n      minutes’ conversation together, received them exactly as might be\\r\\n      expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\\r\\n      against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her\\r\\n      own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to\\r\\n      whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must\\r\\n      principally be owing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to\\r\\n      Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but\\r\\n      poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the\\r\\n      Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was\\r\\n      some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\\r\\n      kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked\\r\\n      after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge\\r\\n      of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And\\r\\n      now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\r\\n      Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\\r\\n      what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out\\r\\n      before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\\r\\n      brother, I do not know what we shall do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\n      after general assurances of his affection for her and all her\\r\\n      family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\\r\\n      and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\\r\\n      Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right\\r\\n      to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it\\r\\n      as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a\\r\\n      few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know\\r\\n      that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not\\r\\n      let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I\\r\\n      shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to\\r\\n      Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what\\r\\n      is to be done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what\\r\\n      I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find\\r\\n      them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married\\r\\n      already, _make_ them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not\\r\\n      let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much\\r\\n      money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And,\\r\\n      above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a\\r\\n      dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and\\r\\n      have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me—such spasms\\r\\n      in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that\\r\\n      I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not\\r\\n      to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\\r\\n      for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,\\r\\n      how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\\r\\n      endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation\\r\\n      to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with\\r\\n      her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left\\r\\n      her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in\\r\\n      the absence of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\\r\\n      real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\\r\\n      attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\\r\\n      enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited\\r\\n      at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household,\\r\\n      and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her\\r\\n      fears and solicitude on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who\\r\\n      had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make\\r\\n      their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other\\r\\n      from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably\\r\\n      calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss\\r\\n      of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself\\r\\n      incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than\\r\\n      usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress\\r\\n      enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of\\r\\n      grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\\r\\n      talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the\\r\\n      wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\\r\\n      added, “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from\\r\\n      it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\\r\\n      irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\\r\\n      that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and\\r\\n      that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\\r\\n      undeserving of the other sex.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\\r\\n      oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console\\r\\n      herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before\\r\\n      them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\r\\n      half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\\r\\n      herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane\\r\\n      was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general\\r\\n      lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\\r\\n      Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\\r\\n      not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\\r\\n      subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it\\r\\n      which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What\\r\\n      did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything\\r\\n      before the elopement took place? They must have seen them\\r\\n      together for ever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\\r\\n      partiality, especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him\\r\\n      any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive\\r\\n      and kind to the utmost. He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure\\r\\n      us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone\\r\\n      to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\\r\\n      his journey.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he\\r\\n      know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny\\r\\n      himself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing\\r\\n      anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\\r\\n      about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\\r\\n      marrying—and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have\\r\\n      been misunderstood before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\\r\\n      entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I\\r\\n      felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister’s happiness\\r\\n      with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not\\r\\n      been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of\\r\\n      that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then\\r\\n      owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest\\r\\n      of us, that in Lydia’s last letter she had prepared her for such\\r\\n      a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each\\r\\n      other, many weeks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But not before they went to Brighton?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, I believe not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?\\r\\n      Does he know his real character?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\\r\\n      formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\r\\n      And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he\\r\\n      left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of\\r\\n      him, this could not have happened!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to\\r\\n      expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their\\r\\n      present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the\\r\\n      best intentions.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to\\r\\n      his wife?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He brought it with him for us to see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\r\\n      These were the contents:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Harriet,\\r\\n      “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\\r\\n      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I\\r\\n      am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess\\r\\n      with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man\\r\\n      in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy\\r\\n      without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send\\r\\n      them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it\\r\\n      will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign\\r\\n      my name ‘Lydia Wickham.’ What a good joke it will be! I can\\r\\n      hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not\\r\\n      keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I\\r\\n      hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will\\r\\n      dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I\\r\\n      shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you\\r\\n      would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown\\r\\n      before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel\\r\\n      Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your affectionate friend,\\r\\n      “LYDIA BENNET.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she\\r\\n      had finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a\\r\\n      moment! But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the\\r\\n      subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade\\r\\n      her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor\\r\\n      father! how he must have felt it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for\\r\\n      full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the\\r\\n      whole house in such confusion!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it\\r\\n      who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a\\r\\n      time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I\\r\\n      endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid\\r\\n      I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what\\r\\n      might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not\\r\\n      look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care\\r\\n      and anxiety upon yourself alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\\r\\n      every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either\\r\\n      of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\\r\\n      that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt\\r\\n      Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away;\\r\\n      and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of\\r\\n      great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very\\r\\n      kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us,\\r\\n      and offered her services, or any of her daughters’, if they\\r\\n      should be of use to us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps\\r\\n      she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\\r\\n      cannot see too little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is\\r\\n      impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at\\r\\n      a distance, and be satisfied.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father\\r\\n      had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his\\r\\n      daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place\\r\\n      where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\\r\\n      anything could be made out from them. His principal object must\\r\\n      be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them\\r\\n      from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he\\r\\n      thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady’s removing\\r\\n      from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make\\r\\n      enquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house\\r\\n      the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make\\r\\n      enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out\\r\\n      the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other\\r\\n      designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be\\r\\n      gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had\\r\\n      difficulty in finding out even so much as this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 48\\r\\n\\r\\n      The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\\r\\n      next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\\r\\n      from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a\\r\\n      most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\\r\\n      they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he\\r\\n      had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of _that_ they\\r\\n      would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only\\r\\n      for the letters before he set off.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\\r\\n      constant information of what was going on, and their uncle\\r\\n      promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\\r\\n      Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\\r\\n      sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband’s\\r\\n      not being killed in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a\\r\\n      few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\\r\\n      serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\\r\\n      freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\\r\\n      always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\\r\\n      them up—though, as she never came without reporting some fresh\\r\\n      instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom\\r\\n      went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\\r\\n      them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\\r\\n      months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared\\r\\n      to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues,\\r\\n      all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into\\r\\n      every tradesman’s family. Everybody declared that he was the\\r\\n      wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out\\r\\n      that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.\\r\\n      Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said,\\r\\n      believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister’s ruin\\r\\n      more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it,\\r\\n      became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come\\r\\n      when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\\r\\n      entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained\\r\\n      some news of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\\r\\n      received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he\\r\\n      had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come\\r\\n      to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and\\r\\n      Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory\\r\\n      information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the\\r\\n      principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they\\r\\n      might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London,\\r\\n      before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not\\r\\n      expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was\\r\\n      eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London\\r\\n      and promised to write again very soon. There was also a\\r\\n      postscript to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\r\\n      possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,\\r\\n      whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be\\r\\n      likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself.\\r\\n      If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability\\r\\n      of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential\\r\\n      consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel\\r\\n      Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy\\r\\n      us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could\\r\\n      tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other\\r\\n      person.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference\\r\\n      to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give\\r\\n      any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment\\r\\n      deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations,\\r\\n      except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many\\r\\n      years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in\\r\\n      the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though\\r\\n      she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a\\r\\n      something to look forward to.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\\r\\n      anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival\\r\\n      of letters was the grand object of every morning’s impatience.\\r\\n      Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be\\r\\n      communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some\\r\\n      news of importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\\r\\n      for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\\r\\n      which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\\r\\n      him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew\\r\\n      what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and\\r\\n      read it likewise. It was as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Sir,\\r\\n      “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\\r\\n      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are\\r\\n      now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a\\r\\n      letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.\\r\\n      Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your\\r\\n      respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of\\r\\n      the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time\\r\\n      can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can\\r\\n      alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a\\r\\n      circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a\\r\\n      parent’s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a\\r\\n      blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be\\r\\n      lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\\r\\n      informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your\\r\\n      daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;\\r\\n      though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must\\r\\n      be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity,\\r\\n      at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to\\r\\n      be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins,\\r\\n      but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have\\r\\n      related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this\\r\\n      false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of\\r\\n      all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself\\r\\n      condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?\\r\\n      And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with\\r\\n      augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for\\r\\n      had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your\\r\\n      sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console\\r\\n      yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child\\r\\n      from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of\\r\\n      her own heinous offense.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\\r\\n      from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\\r\\n      nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single\\r\\n      relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was\\r\\n      certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances\\r\\n      had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did\\r\\n      not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any\\r\\n      of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as\\r\\n      likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his\\r\\n      own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in\\r\\n      addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations, for it\\r\\n      had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a\\r\\n      very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than\\r\\n      a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at\\r\\n      Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour\\r\\n      were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to\\r\\n      conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard\\r\\n      them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly\\r\\n      unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\\r\\n      their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\r\\n      Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours,\\r\\n      he had yielded to his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would\\r\\n      return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion\\r\\n      might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much\\r\\n      satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her\\r\\n      anxiety for his life had been before.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried.\\r\\n      “Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is\\r\\n      to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that\\r\\n      she and the children should go to London, at the same time that\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the\\r\\n      first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to\\r\\n      Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and\\r\\n      her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the\\r\\n      world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them\\r\\n      by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from\\r\\n      him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her\\r\\n      return that could come from Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse\\r\\n      for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore,\\r\\n      could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who\\r\\n      was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings,\\r\\n      was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she\\r\\n      could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It\\r\\n      would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of\\r\\n      two.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\r\\n      philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in\\r\\n      the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\\r\\n      taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\\r\\n      courage to speak of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\\r\\n      that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\\r\\n      her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured,\\r\\n      he replied, “Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself?\\r\\n      It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so\\r\\n      prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how\\r\\n      much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered\\r\\n      by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Do you suppose them to be in London?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence\\r\\n      there will probably be of some duration.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Then after a short silence he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice\\r\\n      to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some\\r\\n      greatness of mind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\\r\\n      mother’s tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such\\r\\n      an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will\\r\\n      sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as\\r\\n      much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty\\r\\n      runs away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If _I_\\r\\n      should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as\\r\\n      Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\\r\\n      be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is\\r\\n      ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\\r\\n      village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\\r\\n      with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors\\r\\n      till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\\r\\n      in a rational manner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to\\r\\n      cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are\\r\\n      a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\\r\\n      at the end of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 49\\r\\n\\r\\n      Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\\r\\n      walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the\\r\\n      housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to\\r\\n      call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead\\r\\n      of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to\\r\\n      Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but\\r\\n      I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I\\r\\n      took the liberty of coming to ask.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you\\r\\n      know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He\\r\\n      has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\r\\n      They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\\r\\n      thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were\\r\\n      on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when\\r\\n      they were met by the butler, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards\\r\\n      the little copse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\\r\\n      once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\\r\\n      deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of\\r\\n      the paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as\\r\\n      Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\\r\\n      breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the\\r\\n      letter from his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself\\r\\n      what it is about.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August_ 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Brother,\\r\\n      “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\\r\\n      as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon\\r\\n      after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out\\r\\n      in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till\\r\\n      we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen\\r\\n      them both—”\\r\\n          “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are\\r\\n          married!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth read on:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find\\r\\n      there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\\r\\n      perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your\\r\\n      side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is\\r\\n      required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,\\r\\n      her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\\r\\n      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\r\\n      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\\r\\n      your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\r\\n      which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\\r\\n      with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall\\r\\n      send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me\\r\\n      your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\\r\\n      that Mr. Wickham’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are\\r\\n      generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that\\r\\n      respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money,\\r\\n      even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in\\r\\n      addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case,\\r\\n      you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole\\r\\n      of this business, I will immediately give directions to\\r\\n      Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be\\r\\n      the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore\\r\\n      stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.\\r\\n      Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write\\r\\n      explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be\\r\\n      married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She\\r\\n      comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more\\r\\n      is determined on. Yours, etc.,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “EDW. GARDINER.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it\\r\\n      be possible that he will marry her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said\\r\\n      her sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No; but it must be done soon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time\\r\\n      before he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write\\r\\n      immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a\\r\\n      case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble\\r\\n      yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the\\r\\n      house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And may I ask—” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must\\r\\n      be complied with.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But\\r\\n      there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how\\r\\n      much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the\\r\\n      other, how am I ever to pay him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight\\r\\n      a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty\\r\\n      after I am gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred\\r\\n      to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to\\r\\n      remain! Oh! it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I\\r\\n      am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all\\r\\n      this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No,” said her father; “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a\\r\\n      farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to\\r\\n      think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\\r\\n      repaid?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\\r\\n      continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then\\r\\n      went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\\r\\n      breakfast-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as\\r\\n      they were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for _this_ we\\r\\n      are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their\\r\\n      chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are\\r\\n      forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he\\r\\n      certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for\\r\\n      her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\\r\\n      him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\\r\\n      it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have\\r\\n      more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,”\\r\\n      said Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our\\r\\n      sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\\r\\n      them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness\\r\\n      of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her\\r\\n      home, and affording her their personal protection and\\r\\n      countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of\\r\\n      gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually\\r\\n      with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she\\r\\n      will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\\r\\n      first sees my aunt!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,”\\r\\n      said Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His\\r\\n      consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is\\r\\n      come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will\\r\\n      steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,\\r\\n      and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past\\r\\n      imprudence forgotten.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither\\r\\n      you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of\\r\\n      it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\\r\\n      likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to\\r\\n      the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would\\r\\n      not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and,\\r\\n      without raising his head, coolly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Just as you please.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Take whatever you like, and get away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\\r\\n      up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\\r\\n      one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight\\r\\n      preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr.\\r\\n      Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married, her joy burst\\r\\n      forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She\\r\\n      was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever\\r\\n      been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\\r\\n      would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\\r\\n      felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She\\r\\n      will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at\\r\\n      sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he\\r\\n      would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear\\r\\n      Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write\\r\\n      to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run\\r\\n      down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay,\\r\\n      stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will\\r\\n      put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we\\r\\n      shall be together when we meet!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\\r\\n      violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\\r\\n      obligations which Mr. Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a\\r\\n      great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has\\r\\n      pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it\\r\\n      but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and\\r\\n      my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\\r\\n      first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\\r\\n      presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a\\r\\n      daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was\\r\\n      only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter,\\r\\n      that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write\\r\\n      for me. We will settle with your father about the money\\r\\n      afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,\\r\\n      and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful\\r\\n      orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her\\r\\n      to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s\\r\\n      delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother\\r\\n      was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,\\r\\n      too, came into her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and\\r\\n      tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come\\r\\n      back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and\\r\\n      order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I\\r\\n      am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here\\r\\n      comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss\\r\\n      Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of\\r\\n      punch to make merry at her wedding.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received\\r\\n      her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this\\r\\n      folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with\\r\\n      freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it\\r\\n      was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and\\r\\n      though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\\r\\n      worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\\r\\n      looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\\r\\n      felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 50\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\\r\\n      that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\\r\\n      annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\\r\\n      wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had\\r\\n      he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\\r\\n      indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now\\r\\n      be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of\\r\\n      the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband\\r\\n      might then have rested in its proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\\r\\n      anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\\r\\n      brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\\r\\n      the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\\r\\n      soon as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\\r\\n      perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The\\r\\n      son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should\\r\\n      be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means\\r\\n      be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world,\\r\\n      but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years\\r\\n      after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would. This event\\r\\n      had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\\r\\n      saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband’s\\r\\n      love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\\r\\n      income.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be\\r\\n      divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\r\\n      This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now\\r\\n      to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\\r\\n      acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful\\r\\n      acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed\\r\\n      most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\r\\n      approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil\\r\\n      the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before\\r\\n      supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\\r\\n      daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\\r\\n      himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten\\r\\n      pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them;\\r\\n      for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual\\r\\n      presents in money which passed to her through her mother’s hands,\\r\\n      Lydia’s expenses had been very little within that sum.\\r\\n\\r\\n      That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\\r\\n      too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\\r\\n      was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When\\r\\n      the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\\r\\n      seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\\r\\n      indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\\r\\n      in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged\\r\\n      to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his\\r\\n      brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The good news spread quickly through the house, and with\\r\\n      proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in\\r\\n      the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been\\r\\n      more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come\\r\\n      upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded\\r\\n      from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to\\r\\n      be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her\\r\\n      well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old\\r\\n      ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this\\r\\n      change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery\\r\\n      was considered certain.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\\r\\n      this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\\r\\n      and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a\\r\\n      damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been\\r\\n      the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on\\r\\n      the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran\\r\\n      wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new\\r\\n      carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the\\r\\n      neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and,\\r\\n      without knowing or considering what their income might be,\\r\\n      rejected many as deficient in size and importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit\\r\\n      it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;\\r\\n      but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten\\r\\n      miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\\r\\n      servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her:\\r\\n      “Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your\\r\\n      son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into\\r\\n      _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\\r\\n      admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by\\r\\n      receiving them at Longbourn.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\\r\\n      firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\\r\\n      amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea\\r\\n      to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should\\r\\n      receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be\\r\\n      carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse\\r\\n      his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would\\r\\n      scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She\\r\\n      was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must\\r\\n      reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at\\r\\n      her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took\\r\\n      place.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\\r\\n      distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\\r\\n      with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so\\r\\n      shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might\\r\\n      hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who\\r\\n      were not immediately on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There\\r\\n      were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently\\r\\n      depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge\\r\\n      of a sister’s frailty would have mortified her so much—not,\\r\\n      however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to\\r\\n      herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between\\r\\n      them. Had Lydia’s marriage been concluded on the most honourable\\r\\n      terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect\\r\\n      himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now\\r\\n      be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a\\r\\n      man whom he so justly scorned.\\r\\n\\r\\n      From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.\\r\\n      The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself\\r\\n      of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation\\r\\n      survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved;\\r\\n      she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous\\r\\n      of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by\\r\\n      it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance\\r\\n      of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have\\r\\n      been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should\\r\\n      meet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that\\r\\n      the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago,\\r\\n      would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was\\r\\n      as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex;\\r\\n      but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\\r\\n      disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding\\r\\n      and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her\\r\\n      wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of\\r\\n      both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been\\r\\n      softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement,\\r\\n      information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received\\r\\n      benefit of greater importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude\\r\\n      what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different\\r\\n      tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon\\r\\n      to be formed in their family.\\r\\n\\r\\n      How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\\r\\n      independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent\\r\\n      happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together\\r\\n      because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could\\r\\n      easily conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\\r\\n      acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\\r\\n      eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\\r\\n      concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\\r\\n      mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was\\r\\n      to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\\r\\n      militia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon\\r\\n      as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me,\\r\\n      in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,\\r\\n      both on his account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention\\r\\n      to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are\\r\\n      still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He\\r\\n      has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——’s regiment, now\\r\\n      quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from\\r\\n      this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among\\r\\n      different people, where they may each have a character to\\r\\n      preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to\\r\\n      Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and\\r\\n      to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment,\\r\\n      for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the\\r\\n      trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in\\r\\n      Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his\\r\\n      information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he\\r\\n      has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will\\r\\n      be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless\\r\\n      they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before\\r\\n      she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully\\r\\n      remembered to you and her mother.—Yours, etc.,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “E. GARDINER.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\\r\\n      removal from the ——shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being\\r\\n      settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure\\r\\n      and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her\\r\\n      plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe\\r\\n      disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia\\r\\n      should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with\\r\\n      everybody, and had so many favourites.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite\\r\\n      shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young\\r\\n      men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so\\r\\n      pleasant in General ——’s regiment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\r\\n      admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\r\\n      received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,\\r\\n      who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings\\r\\n      and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by\\r\\n      her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so\\r\\n      mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as\\r\\n      they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they\\r\\n      thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the\\r\\n      satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her\\r\\n      married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to\\r\\n      the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,\\r\\n      he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that\\r\\n      as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to\\r\\n      Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should\\r\\n      consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own\\r\\n      inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object\\r\\n      of her wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 51\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\\r\\n      for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was\\r\\n      sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by\\r\\n      dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets,\\r\\n      and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would\\r\\n      have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, and was\\r\\n      wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\\r\\n      receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\\r\\n      carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\\r\\n      grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\\r\\n      open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards,\\r\\n      embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with\\r\\n      an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and\\r\\n      wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of\\r\\n      their happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was\\r\\n      not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;\\r\\n      and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young\\r\\n      couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was\\r\\n      disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia\\r\\n      still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\\r\\n      from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when\\r\\n      at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took\\r\\n      notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a\\r\\n      laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\\r\\n      manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\\r\\n      marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\\r\\n      address, while he claimed their relationship, would have\\r\\n      delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite\\r\\n      equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within\\r\\n      herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an\\r\\n      impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of\\r\\n      the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\\r\\n      colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n      There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could\\r\\n      neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\\r\\n      sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in\\r\\n      that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very\\r\\n      unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have\\r\\n      the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was\\r\\n      recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects\\r\\n      which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went\\r\\n      away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been\\r\\n      things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went\\r\\n      away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came\\r\\n      back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth\\r\\n      looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\\r\\n      anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\\r\\n      “Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I\\r\\n      was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in\\r\\n      his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let\\r\\n      down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let\\r\\n      my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the\\r\\n      ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the\\r\\n      room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through\\r\\n      the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough\\r\\n      to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right\\r\\n      hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take\\r\\n      your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married\\r\\n      woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\\r\\n      embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\r\\n      Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\\r\\n      hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by each of them; and in the\\r\\n      mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of\\r\\n      being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\\r\\n      breakfast room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\\r\\n      charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope\\r\\n      they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton.\\r\\n      That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we\\r\\n      did not all go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I\\r\\n      don’t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\\r\\n      things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.\\r\\n      We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there\\r\\n      will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for\\r\\n      them all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\\r\\n      sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them\\r\\n      before the winter is over.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I\\r\\n      do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr.\\r\\n      Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he\\r\\n      was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\\r\\n      short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\\r\\n      her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These\\r\\n      parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even\\r\\n      more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\\r\\n      expected to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had\\r\\n      scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the\\r\\n      reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the\\r\\n      strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have\\r\\n      wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope\\r\\n      with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was\\r\\n      rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were\\r\\n      the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of\\r\\n      having a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on\\r\\n      every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He\\r\\n      did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill\\r\\n      more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the\\r\\n      country.\\r\\n\\r\\n      One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\\r\\n      her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.\\r\\n      You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\r\\n      Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too\\r\\n      little said on the subject.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We\\r\\n      were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s\\r\\n      lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should\\r\\n      all be there by eleven o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to\\r\\n      go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,\\r\\n      Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\\r\\n      you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I\\r\\n      should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the\\r\\n      time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she\\r\\n      was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\\r\\n      ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I\\r\\n      longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would\\r\\n      never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my\\r\\n      uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with\\r\\n      them. If you’ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of\\r\\n      doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme,\\r\\n      or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the\\r\\n      Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came\\r\\n      to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that\\r\\n      horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get\\r\\n      together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did\\r\\n      not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\\r\\n      were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,\\r\\n      luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all\\r\\n      set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been\\r\\n      prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      might have done as well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But\\r\\n      gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word\\r\\n      about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?\\r\\n      It was to be such a secret!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\\r\\n      subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;\\r\\n      “we will ask you no questions.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell\\r\\n      you all, and then Wickham would be angry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out\\r\\n      of her power, by running away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\\r\\n      least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had\\r\\n      been at her sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly\\r\\n      among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least\\r\\n      temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and\\r\\n      wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.\\r\\n      Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the\\r\\n      noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such\\r\\n      suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short\\r\\n      letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had\\r\\n      dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\\r\\n      intended.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must\\r\\n      be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\\r\\n      (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\\r\\n      been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me\\r\\n      understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in\\r\\n      the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must\\r\\n      endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, as she\\r\\n      finished the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in\\r\\n      an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and\\r\\n      stratagems to find it out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\r\\n      Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\\r\\n      glad of it;—till it appeared whether her enquiries would receive\\r\\n      any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 52\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\\r\\n      letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in\\r\\n      possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she\\r\\n      was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the\\r\\n      benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter\\r\\n      convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Gracechurch Street, _Sept_. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Niece,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\r\\n      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing\\r\\n      will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\\r\\n      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\\r\\n      Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know\\r\\n      that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_\\r\\n      side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\\r\\n      impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing\\r\\n      but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\\r\\n      him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\\r\\n      ignorant, I must be more explicit.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had\\r\\n      a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with\\r\\n      him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my\\r\\n      curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have\\r\\n      been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where\\r\\n      your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked\\r\\n      with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can\\r\\n      collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and\\r\\n      came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive\\r\\n      professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that\\r\\n      Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it\\r\\n      impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in\\r\\n      him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\\r\\n      confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his\\r\\n      private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for\\r\\n      itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and\\r\\n      endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.\\r\\n      If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace\\r\\n      him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to\\r\\n      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which\\r\\n      was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\\r\\n      reason for his resolving to follow us.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\\r\\n      governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on\\r\\n      some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She\\r\\n      then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since\\r\\n      maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he\\r\\n      knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for\\r\\n      intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or\\r\\n      three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would\\r\\n      not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption,\\r\\n      for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham\\r\\n      indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\\r\\n      she been able to receive them into her house, they would have\\r\\n      taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind\\r\\n      friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street.\\r\\n      He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His\\r\\n      first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her\\r\\n      to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\\r\\n      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\\r\\n      offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found\\r\\n      Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\\r\\n      for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not\\r\\n      hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some\\r\\n      time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were\\r\\n      her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and\\r\\n      expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with\\r\\n      Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He\\r\\n      confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of\\r\\n      some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not\\r\\n      to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own\\r\\n      folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and\\r\\n      as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about\\r\\n      it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew\\r\\n      he should have nothing to live on.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.\\r\\n      Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\\r\\n      been able to do something for him, and his situation must have\\r\\n      been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this\\r\\n      question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more\\r\\n      effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.\\r\\n      Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof\\r\\n      against the temptation of immediate relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\r\\n      Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\\r\\n      was reduced to be reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Everything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step\\r\\n      was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in\\r\\n      Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr.\\r\\n      Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further\\r\\n      enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town\\r\\n      the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person\\r\\n      whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore\\r\\n      readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the\\r\\n      former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was\\r\\n      only known that a gentleman had called on business.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at\\r\\n      home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\\r\\n      together.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not\\r\\n      all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was\\r\\n      sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\\r\\n      fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\r\\n      after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times,\\r\\n      but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did\\r\\n      not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be\\r\\n      thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most\\r\\n      readily have settled the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “They battled it together for a long time, which was more than\\r\\n      either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at\\r\\n      last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed\\r\\n      to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having\\r\\n      the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain;\\r\\n      and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great\\r\\n      pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him\\r\\n      of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\r\\n      But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at\\r\\n      most.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the\\r\\n      young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to\\r\\n      considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in\\r\\n      addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission\\r\\n      purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone,\\r\\n      was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\\r\\n      reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s\\r\\n      character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had\\r\\n      been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\\r\\n      in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\\r\\n      reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all\\r\\n      this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured\\r\\n      that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him\\r\\n      credit for _another interest_ in the affair.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends,\\r\\n      who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he\\r\\n      should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and\\r\\n      all money matters were then to receive the last finish.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation\\r\\n      which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least\\r\\n      it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and\\r\\n      Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was exactly\\r\\n      what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would\\r\\n      not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\\r\\n      while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\\r\\n      last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\\r\\n      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\\r\\n      fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious\\r\\n      manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\\r\\n      done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If\\r\\n      she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not\\r\\n      listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my\\r\\n      dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with\\r\\n      her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\\r\\n      attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to\\r\\n      leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry\\r\\n      with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying\\r\\n      (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.\\r\\n      His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as\\r\\n      when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all\\r\\n      please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and\\r\\n      _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him. I\\r\\n      thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But\\r\\n      slyness seems the fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do\\r\\n      not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be\\r\\n      quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton,\\r\\n      with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this\\r\\n      half hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yours, very sincerely,\\r\\n      “M. GARDINER.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of\\r\\n      spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure\\r\\n      or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled\\r\\n      suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might\\r\\n      have been doing to forward her sister’s match, which she had\\r\\n      feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be\\r\\n      probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain\\r\\n      of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be\\r\\n      true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on\\r\\n      himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\\r\\n      research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman\\r\\n      whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to\\r\\n      meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe,\\r\\n      the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name\\r\\n      it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a\\r\\n      girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did\\r\\n      whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\\r\\n      checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her\\r\\n      vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection\\r\\n      for her—for a woman who had already refused him—as able to\\r\\n      overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against\\r\\n      relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind\\r\\n      of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure,\\r\\n      done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a\\r\\n      reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch\\r\\n      of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\\r\\n      wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it;\\r\\n      and though she would not place herself as his principal\\r\\n      inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality\\r\\n      for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of\\r\\n      mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly\\r\\n      painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who\\r\\n      could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia,\\r\\n      her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she\\r\\n      grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,\\r\\n      every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself\\r\\n      she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause\\r\\n      of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of\\r\\n      himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and\\r\\n      again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even\\r\\n      sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding\\r\\n      how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that\\r\\n      affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one’s\\r\\n      approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was\\r\\n      overtaken by Wickham.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?”\\r\\n      said he, as he joined her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not\\r\\n      follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I should be sorry indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good\\r\\n      friends; and now we are better.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “True. Are the others coming out?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage\\r\\n      to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and\\r\\n      aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She replied in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be\\r\\n      too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.\\r\\n      And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she\\r\\n      was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my\\r\\n      name to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, she did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And what did she say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not\\r\\n      turned out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things\\r\\n      are strangely misrepresented.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\\r\\n      silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each\\r\\n      other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\\r\\n      Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at\\r\\n      this time of year.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I\\r\\n      thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And do you like her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Very much.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\\r\\n      this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very\\r\\n      promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out\\r\\n      well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Did you go by the village of Kympton?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not recollect that we did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\\r\\n      had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would\\r\\n      have suited me in every respect.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How should you have liked making sermons?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my\\r\\n      duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought\\r\\n      not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing\\r\\n      for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have\\r\\n      answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you\\r\\n      ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that\\r\\n      it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\\r\\n      present patron.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from\\r\\n      the first, you may remember.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was\\r\\n      not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you\\r\\n      actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and\\r\\n      that the business had been compromised accordingly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may\\r\\n      remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of\\r\\n      it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked\\r\\n      fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to\\r\\n      provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not\\r\\n      let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be\\r\\n      always of one mind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry,\\r\\n      though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 53\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation\\r\\n      that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear\\r\\n      sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was\\r\\n      pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no\\r\\n      means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle,\\r\\n      was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Write to me very often, my dear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “As often as I can. But you know married women have never much\\r\\n      time for writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have\\r\\n      nothing else to do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s.\\r\\n      He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were\\r\\n      out of the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and\\r\\n      makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even\\r\\n      Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several\\r\\n      days.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as\\r\\n      parting with one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a\\r\\n      daughter,” said Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied\\r\\n      that your other four are single.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is\\r\\n      married, but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so\\r\\n      far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so\\r\\n      soon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was\\r\\n      shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of\\r\\n      hope, by an article of news which then began to be in\\r\\n      circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders\\r\\n      to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in\\r\\n      a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was\\r\\n      quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook\\r\\n      her head by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for\\r\\n      Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the\\r\\n      better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us,\\r\\n      you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But,\\r\\n      however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes\\r\\n      it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us.\\r\\n      You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word\\r\\n      about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was\\r\\n      in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself\\r\\n      on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was\\r\\n      certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very\\r\\n      likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher’s, she told me,\\r\\n      on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got\\r\\n      three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without\\r\\n      changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his\\r\\n      name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together,\\r\\n      she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the\\r\\n      present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t\\r\\n      imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the\\r\\n      moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure\\r\\n      you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or\\r\\n      pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we\\r\\n      shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but\\r\\n      I dread other people’s remarks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him\\r\\n      in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming\\r\\n      there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she\\r\\n      still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the\\r\\n      greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend’s\\r\\n      permission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man\\r\\n      cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without\\r\\n      raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be\\r\\n      her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could\\r\\n      easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were\\r\\n      more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\\r\\n      parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      “you will wait on him of course.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised,\\r\\n      if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it\\r\\n      ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand\\r\\n      again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an\\r\\n      attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his\\r\\n      returning to Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our\\r\\n      society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not\\r\\n      spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they\\r\\n      go away and come back again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do\\r\\n      not wait on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him\\r\\n      to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the\\r\\n      Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there\\r\\n      will be just room at table for him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\\r\\n      husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that\\r\\n      her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it,\\r\\n      before _they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,—\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her\\r\\n      sister. “It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\\r\\n      indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\\r\\n      talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one\\r\\n      can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be,\\r\\n      when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth;\\r\\n      “but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the\\r\\n      usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied\\r\\n      me, because you have always so much.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of\\r\\n      servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the\\r\\n      period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as\\r\\n      it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their\\r\\n      invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on\\r\\n      the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw\\r\\n      him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride\\r\\n      towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane\\r\\n      resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy\\r\\n      her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with\\r\\n      him, and sat down again by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it\\r\\n      be?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do\\r\\n      not know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be\\r\\n      with him before. Mr. what’s-his-name. That tall, proud man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any\\r\\n      friend of Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure;\\r\\n      but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but\\r\\n      little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the\\r\\n      awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost\\r\\n      for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both\\r\\n      sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and\\r\\n      of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her\\r\\n      dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only\\r\\n      as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either of them.\\r\\n      But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\\r\\n      suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew\\r\\n      Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment\\r\\n      towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she\\r\\n      had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own\\r\\n      more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole\\r\\n      family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she\\r\\n      regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at\\r\\n      least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her\\r\\n      astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to\\r\\n      Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to\\r\\n      what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in\\r\\n      Derbyshire.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half\\r\\n      a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added\\r\\n      lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that\\r\\n      his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would\\r\\n      not be secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be\\r\\n      early enough for expectation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without\\r\\n      daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them\\r\\n      to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the\\r\\n      door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than\\r\\n      Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen’s appearing, her colour\\r\\n      increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a\\r\\n      propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of\\r\\n      resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and\\r\\n      sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\\r\\n      often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He\\r\\n      looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been\\r\\n      used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at\\r\\n      Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother’s presence be\\r\\n      what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not\\r\\n      an improbable, conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short\\r\\n      period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was\\r\\n      received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her\\r\\n      two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold\\r\\n      and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his\\r\\n      friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the\\r\\n      latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\\r\\n      irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\\r\\n      degree by a distinction so ill applied.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a\\r\\n      question which she could not answer without confusion, said\\r\\n      scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the\\r\\n      reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.\\r\\n      There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.\\r\\n      But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his\\r\\n      voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of\\r\\n      curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found\\r\\n      him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object\\r\\n      but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please,\\r\\n      than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was\\r\\n      disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he\\r\\n      come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;\\r\\n      and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He readily agreed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People\\r\\n      _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;\\r\\n      but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have\\r\\n      happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is\\r\\n      married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you\\r\\n      have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It\\r\\n      was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put\\r\\n      in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham,\\r\\n      Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said\\r\\n      of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was\\r\\n      my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\\r\\n      make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\r\\n      Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,\\r\\n      therefore, she could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well\\r\\n      married,” continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr.\\r\\n      Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.\\r\\n      They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it\\r\\n      seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His\\r\\n      regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving\\r\\n      the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank\\r\\n      Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he\\r\\n      deserves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\\r\\n      misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew\\r\\n      from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else\\r\\n      had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he\\r\\n      meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he\\r\\n      believed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her\\r\\n      mother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you\\r\\n      please on Mr. Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy\\r\\n      to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\\r\\n      attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had\\r\\n      flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would\\r\\n      be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant,\\r\\n      she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself\\r\\n      amends for moments of such painful confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more\\r\\n      to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no\\r\\n      pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me\\r\\n      never see either one or the other again!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\r\\n      compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from\\r\\n      observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the\\r\\n      admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had\\r\\n      spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be\\r\\n      giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she\\r\\n      had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though\\r\\n      not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should\\r\\n      be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she\\r\\n      talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that\\r\\n      she did not always know when she was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\\r\\n      her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine\\r\\n      at Longbourn in a few days time.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for\\r\\n      when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family\\r\\n      dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you\\r\\n      see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did\\r\\n      not come back and keep your engagement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\\r\\n      something of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\r\\n      They then went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and\\r\\n      dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good\\r\\n      table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be\\r\\n      good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or\\r\\n      satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a\\r\\n      year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 54\\r\\n\\r\\n      As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her\\r\\n      spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on\\r\\n      those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour\\r\\n      astonished and vexed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said\\r\\n      she, “did he come at all?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,\\r\\n      when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come\\r\\n      hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing,\\r\\n      teasing, man! I will think no more about him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the\\r\\n      approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look,\\r\\n      which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than\\r\\n      Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel\\r\\n      perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be\\r\\n      embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on\\r\\n      Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we\\r\\n      meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh,\\r\\n      Jane, take care.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\\r\\n      now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in\\r\\n      love with you as ever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy\\r\\n      schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley,\\r\\n      in half an hour’s visit, had revived.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and\\r\\n      the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their\\r\\n      punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they\\r\\n      repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see\\r\\n      whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former\\r\\n      parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother,\\r\\n      occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by\\r\\n      herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane\\r\\n      happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He\\r\\n      placed himself by her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\\r\\n      friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\\r\\n      imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had\\r\\n      she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an\\r\\n      expression of half-laughing alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n      His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\\r\\n      showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\\r\\n      formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\\r\\n      Jane’s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though\\r\\n      she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received\\r\\n      pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the\\r\\n      animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no\\r\\n      cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the\\r\\n      table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She\\r\\n      knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either,\\r\\n      or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to\\r\\n      hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they\\r\\n      spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner\\r\\n      whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness, made the sense of\\r\\n      what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she\\r\\n      would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him\\r\\n      that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\\r\\n      the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\\r\\n      of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not\\r\\n      pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of\\r\\n      conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his\\r\\n      entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the\\r\\n      drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull\\r\\n      to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to\\r\\n      their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure\\r\\n      for the evening must depend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him\\r\\n      up for ever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\\r\\n      answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the\\r\\n      table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring\\r\\n      out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a\\r\\n      single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the\\r\\n      gentlemen’s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her\\r\\n      than ever, and said, in a whisper:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none\\r\\n      of them; do we?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed\\r\\n      him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely\\r\\n      patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged\\r\\n      against herself for being so silly!\\r\\n\\r\\n      “A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish\\r\\n      enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the\\r\\n      sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\\r\\n      proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to\\r\\n      their feelings!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\\r\\n      coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to\\r\\n      Scarborough, these three weeks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\\r\\n      converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her,\\r\\n      however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young\\r\\n      lady’s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the\\r\\n      ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined\\r\\n      by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a\\r\\n      victim to her mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few\\r\\n      moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost\\r\\n      every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening\\r\\n      at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his\\r\\n      eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to\\r\\n      make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\\r\\n      supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of\\r\\n      the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,\\r\\n      “What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off\\r\\n      uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as\\r\\n      any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody\\r\\n      said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times\\r\\n      better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week; and even Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well\\r\\n      done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.\\r\\n      And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs.\\r\\n      Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what\\r\\n      do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have\\r\\n      her at Netherfield at last.’ She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long\\r\\n      is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very\\r\\n      pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them\\r\\n      prodigiously.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\\r\\n      enough of Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\\r\\n      would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\\r\\n      family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\\r\\n      she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next\\r\\n      day, to make his proposals.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to\\r\\n      Elizabeth. “The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one\\r\\n      with the other. I hope we may often meet again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies\\r\\n      me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation\\r\\n      as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish\\r\\n      beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now\\r\\n      are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is\\r\\n      only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a\\r\\n      stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me\\r\\n      smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And how impossible in others!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\r\\n      acknowledge?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all\\r\\n      love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\\r\\n      knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not\\r\\n      make _me_ your confidante.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 55\\r\\n\\r\\n      A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.\\r\\n      His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to\\r\\n      return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and\\r\\n      was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine\\r\\n      with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed\\r\\n      himself engaged elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if\\r\\n      she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of\\r\\n      waiting on them.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Can you come to-morrow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her\\r\\n      invitation was accepted with alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of\\r\\n      them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter’s room, in her\\r\\n      dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley\\r\\n      is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come\\r\\n      to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never\\r\\n      mind Miss Lizzy’s hair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say\\r\\n      Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half\\r\\n      an hour ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be\\r\\n      quick! Where is your sash, my dear?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\\r\\n      go down without one of her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in\\r\\n      the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was\\r\\n      his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two\\r\\n      obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking\\r\\n      and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time,\\r\\n      without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not\\r\\n      observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently\\r\\n      said, “What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me\\r\\n      for? What am I to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat\\r\\n      still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious\\r\\n      occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here,\\r\\n      my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane\\r\\n      instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at\\r\\n      such premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in\\r\\n      to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and\\r\\n      called out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was forced to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her\\r\\n      mother, as soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up\\r\\n      stairs to sit in my dressing-room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\\r\\n      quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then\\r\\n      returned into the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\\r\\n      every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her\\r\\n      daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\\r\\n      addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\\r\\n      officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with\\r\\n      a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to\\r\\n      the daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he\\r\\n      went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with\\r\\n      her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word\\r\\n      passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went\\r\\n      to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded,\\r\\n      unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,\\r\\n      however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have\\r\\n      taken place with that gentleman’s concurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\\r\\n      spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was\\r\\n      much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was\\r\\n      nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his\\r\\n      ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more\\r\\n      communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen\\r\\n      him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the\\r\\n      evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get every\\r\\n      body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\\r\\n      to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon\\r\\n      after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards,\\r\\n      she could not be wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.\\r\\n\\r\\n      But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was\\r\\n      finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to\\r\\n      fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening\\r\\n      the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together\\r\\n      over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had\\r\\n      this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily\\r\\n      turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it\\r\\n      all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought\\r\\n      was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\\r\\n      Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who\\r\\n      as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering\\r\\n      a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence\\r\\n      would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,\\r\\n      with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in\\r\\n      the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve\\r\\n      it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\\r\\n      warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every\\r\\n      sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But\\r\\n      she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half\\r\\n      that remained to be said for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on\\r\\n      any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her\\r\\n      to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father\\r\\n      already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give\\r\\n      such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much\\r\\n      happiness!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up\\r\\n      the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity\\r\\n      and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given\\r\\n      them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\\r\\n      circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance!\\r\\n      the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with\\r\\n      her father had been short and to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare\\r\\n      say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\\r\\n      wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily\\r\\n      expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They\\r\\n      shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came\\r\\n      down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own\\r\\n      happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of his being a\\r\\n      lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity\\r\\n      to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the\\r\\n      excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane,\\r\\n      and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\\r\\n      himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the\\r\\n      satisfaction of Miss Bennet’s mind gave a glow of such sweet\\r\\n      animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\r\\n      Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation\\r\\n      in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked\\r\\n      to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet\\r\\n      joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how\\r\\n      really happy he was.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till\\r\\n      their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was\\r\\n      gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\r\\n      goodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\\r\\n      thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of\\r\\n      your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means\\r\\n      unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever\\r\\n      be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and\\r\\n      so generous, that you will always exceed your income.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\\r\\n      would be unpardonable in _me_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what\\r\\n      are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and\\r\\n      very likely more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear,\\r\\n      dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep\\r\\n      all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so,\\r\\n      at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I\\r\\n      remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into\\r\\n      Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you\\r\\n      should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\\r\\n      ever was seen!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition\\r\\n      her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her\\r\\n      younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects\\r\\n      of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and\\r\\n      Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\\r\\n      Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\\r\\n      remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\\r\\n      neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an\\r\\n      invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\\r\\n      sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow\\r\\n      on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both\\r\\n      of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.\\r\\n      In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth,\\r\\n      for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone,\\r\\n      Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me\\r\\n      that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I\\r\\n      had not believed it possible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account\\r\\n      for it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It must have been his sister’s doing. They were certainly no\\r\\n      friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,\\r\\n      since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many\\r\\n      respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their\\r\\n      brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we\\r\\n      shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once\\r\\n      were to each other.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I\\r\\n      ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see\\r\\n      you again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last\\r\\n      November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of\\r\\n      _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down\\r\\n      again!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of\\r\\n      his modesty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\\r\\n      diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\\r\\n      qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed\\r\\n      the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most\\r\\n      generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a\\r\\n      circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!”\\r\\n      cried Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and\\r\\n      blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there\\r\\n      were but such another man for you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy\\r\\n      as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can\\r\\n      have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and,\\r\\n      perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.\\r\\n      Collins in time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be\\r\\n      long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.\\r\\n      Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the\\r\\n      same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in\\r\\n      the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first\\r\\n      run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for\\r\\n      misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 56\\r\\n\\r\\n      One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane\\r\\n      had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting\\r\\n      together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn\\r\\n      to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a\\r\\n      chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the\\r\\n      morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to\\r\\n      that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and\\r\\n      neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded\\r\\n      it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\\r\\n      somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet\\r\\n      to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with\\r\\n      him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of\\r\\n      the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,\\r\\n      till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was\\r\\n      Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\r\\n      astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them,\\r\\n      even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\\r\\n      made no other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight\\r\\n      inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\r\\n      Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship’s\\r\\n      entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of\\r\\n      such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.\\r\\n      After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to\\r\\n      Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\\r\\n      mother.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady\\r\\n      Catherine. “She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all\\r\\n      is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,\\r\\n      walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part\\r\\n      of the family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after\\r\\n      a short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but\\r\\n      I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\\r\\n      in summer; the windows are full west.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\\r\\n      and then added:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left\\r\\n      Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her\\r\\n      from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her\\r\\n      calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\\r\\n      some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\\r\\n      very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,\\r\\n      said to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\\r\\n      wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a\\r\\n      turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the\\r\\n      different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\\r\\n      attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\\r\\n      hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\\r\\n      drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\\r\\n      decent looking rooms, walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\r\\n      waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the\\r\\n      gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\\r\\n      make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\\r\\n      than usually insolent and disagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she\\r\\n      looked in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\\r\\n      following manner:—\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of\\r\\n      my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell\\r\\n      you why I come.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to\\r\\n      account for the honour of seeing you here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought\\r\\n      to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere\\r\\n      _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character\\r\\n      has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in\\r\\n      a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from\\r\\n      it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I\\r\\n      was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most\\r\\n      advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet,\\r\\n      would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew,\\r\\n      my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous\\r\\n      falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\\r\\n      the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for\\r\\n      this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth,\\r\\n      colouring with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the\\r\\n      trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by\\r\\n      it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “At once to insist upon having such a report universally\\r\\n      contradicted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said\\r\\n      Elizabeth coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\\r\\n      indeed, such a report is in existence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\\r\\n      industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such\\r\\n      a report is spread abroad?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I never heard that it was.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for\\r\\n      it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.\\r\\n      _You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being\\r\\n      satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\\r\\n      his reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of\\r\\n      infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to\\r\\n      all his family. You may have drawn him in.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to\\r\\n      such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in\\r\\n      the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But you are not entitled to know _mine;_ nor will such behaviour\\r\\n      as this, ever induce me to be explicit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\\r\\n      presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy\\r\\n      is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\\r\\n      he will make an offer to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their\\r\\n      infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the\\r\\n      favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in\\r\\n      their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when\\r\\n      the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\\r\\n      marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of\\r\\n      no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do\\r\\n      you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit\\r\\n      engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\\r\\n      propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his\\r\\n      earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there\\r\\n      is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\\r\\n      certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt\\r\\n      wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you\\r\\n      could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on\\r\\n      others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\\r\\n      confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And\\r\\n      if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\r\\n      Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by\\r\\n      his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\\r\\n      inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and\\r\\n      despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a\\r\\n      disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife\\r\\n      of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness\\r\\n      necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the\\r\\n      whole, have no cause to repine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your\\r\\n      gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to\\r\\n      me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss\\r\\n      Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of\\r\\n      carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not\\r\\n      been used to submit to any person’s whims. I have not been in the\\r\\n      habit of brooking disappointment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_That_ will make your ladyship’s situation at present more\\r\\n      pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and\\r\\n      my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the\\r\\n      maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s,\\r\\n      from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though\\r\\n      untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They\\r\\n      are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their\\r\\n      respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart\\r\\n      pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or\\r\\n      fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If\\r\\n      you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit\\r\\n      the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\\r\\n      quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s\\r\\n      daughter; so far we are equal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But who was your mother?\\r\\n      Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of\\r\\n      their condition.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew\\r\\n      does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\\r\\n      Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say,\\r\\n      after a moment’s deliberation:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine seemed pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\\r\\n      engagement?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I will make no promise of the kind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a\\r\\n      more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a\\r\\n      belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have\\r\\n      given me the assurance I require.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be\\r\\n      intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship\\r\\n      wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you\\r\\n      the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more\\r\\n      probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing\\r\\n      to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\\r\\n      Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which\\r\\n      you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\\r\\n      frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely\\r\\n      mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such\\r\\n      persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your\\r\\n      interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have\\r\\n      certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,\\r\\n      therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\\r\\n      objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I\\r\\n      am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s\\r\\n      infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying\\r\\n      her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and\\r\\n      uncles. And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_\\r\\n      husband, who is the son of his late father’s steward, to be his\\r\\n      brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the\\r\\n      shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully\\r\\n      answered. “You have insulted me in every possible method. I must\\r\\n      beg to return to the house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they\\r\\n      turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\\r\\n      nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a\\r\\n      connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my\\r\\n      sentiments.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are then resolved to have him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that\\r\\n      manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\\r\\n      without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly\\r\\n      unconnected with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey\\r\\n      the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to\\r\\n      ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the\\r\\n      contempt of the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n      “have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No\\r\\n      principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the\\r\\n      indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his\\r\\n      marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern—and the\\r\\n      world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very\\r\\n      well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet,\\r\\n      that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I\\r\\n      hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry\\r\\n      my point.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\\r\\n      door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I\\r\\n      take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\\r\\n      mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously\\r\\n      displeased.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\\r\\n      ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\\r\\n      herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up\\r\\n      stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\\r\\n      dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again\\r\\n      and rest herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was\\r\\n      prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the\\r\\n      Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say,\\r\\n      and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call\\r\\n      on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you,\\r\\n      Lizzy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to\\r\\n      acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 57\\r\\n\\r\\n      The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\\r\\n      Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for\\r\\n      many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady\\r\\n      Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this\\r\\n      journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her\\r\\n      supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to\\r\\n      be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could\\r\\n      originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she\\r\\n      recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and\\r\\n      _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\\r\\n      expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to\\r\\n      supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the\\r\\n      marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.\\r\\n      And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their\\r\\n      communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had\\r\\n      reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost\\r\\n      certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as\\r\\n      possible at some future time.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not\\r\\n      help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of\\r\\n      her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of\\r\\n      her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\\r\\n      Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\\r\\n      and how he might take a similar representation of the evils\\r\\n      attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She\\r\\n      knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his\\r\\n      dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he\\r\\n      thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\\r\\n      was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with\\r\\n      _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own,\\r\\n      his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions\\r\\n      of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to\\r\\n      Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good\\r\\n      sense and solid reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\n      If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had\\r\\n      often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a\\r\\n      relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\\r\\n      be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case\\r\\n      he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way\\r\\n      through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to\\r\\n      Netherfield must give way.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come\\r\\n      to his friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to\\r\\n      understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every\\r\\n      wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting\\r\\n      me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall\\r\\n      soon cease to regret him at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\\r\\n      visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\\r\\n      it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet’s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on\\r\\n      the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her\\r\\n      father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my\\r\\n      room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had\\r\\n      to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in\\r\\n      some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck\\r\\n      her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated\\r\\n      with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\\r\\n      down. He then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\r\\n      exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to\\r\\n      know its contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_\\r\\n      daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a\\r\\n      very important conquest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the\\r\\n      instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\\r\\n      instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be\\r\\n      pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his\\r\\n      letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\\r\\n      continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such\\r\\n      matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to\\r\\n      discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr.\\r\\n      Collins.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with\\r\\n      congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest\\r\\n      daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\\r\\n      good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your\\r\\n      impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates\\r\\n      to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having thus offered you the sincere\\r\\n      congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event,\\r\\n      let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which\\r\\n      we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\\r\\n      Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet,\\r\\n      after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of\\r\\n      her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most\\r\\n      illustrious personages in this land.’\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young\\r\\n      gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the\\r\\n      heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble\\r\\n      kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these\\r\\n      temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of\\r\\n      what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this\\r\\n      gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to\\r\\n      take immediate advantage of.’\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it\\r\\n      comes out:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to\\r\\n      imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on\\r\\n      the match with a friendly eye.’\\r\\n\\r\\n      “_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\\r\\n      surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man\\r\\n      within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have\\r\\n      given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy,\\r\\n      who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who\\r\\n      probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could\\r\\n      only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been\\r\\n      directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Are you not diverted?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! yes. Pray read on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\\r\\n      ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\\r\\n      condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it\\r\\n      became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on\\r\\n      the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what\\r\\n      she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give\\r\\n      the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her\\r\\n      noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\\r\\n      hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’\\r\\n      Mr. Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin\\r\\n      Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only\\r\\n      concerned that their living together before the marriage took\\r\\n      place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect\\r\\n      the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement\\r\\n      at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as\\r\\n      soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and\\r\\n      had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously\\r\\n      have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a\\r\\n      Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\\r\\n      names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of\\r\\n      Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his\\r\\n      dear Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young\\r\\n      olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.\\r\\n      You are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be\\r\\n      affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make\\r\\n      sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so\\r\\n      strange!”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yes—_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other\\r\\n      man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference,\\r\\n      and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much\\r\\n      as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s\\r\\n      correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter\\r\\n      of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over\\r\\n      Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my\\r\\n      son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this\\r\\n      report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as\\r\\n      it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\\r\\n      distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at\\r\\n      a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was\\r\\n      necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father\\r\\n      had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy’s\\r\\n      indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want\\r\\n      of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too\\r\\n      _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 58\\r\\n\\r\\n      Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,\\r\\n      as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to\\r\\n      bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed\\r\\n      after Lady Catherine’s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and,\\r\\n      before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his\\r\\n      aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who\\r\\n      wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It\\r\\n      was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary\\r\\n      could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.\\r\\n      Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip\\r\\n      them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were\\r\\n      to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty\\r\\n      was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly\\r\\n      forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the\\r\\n      same.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\\r\\n      upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a\\r\\n      general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him\\r\\n      alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and,\\r\\n      while her courage was high, she immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of\\r\\n      giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be\\r\\n      wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your\\r\\n      unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known\\r\\n      it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully\\r\\n      I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not\\r\\n      have merely my own gratitude to express.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of\\r\\n      surprise and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what\\r\\n      may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not\\r\\n      think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first\\r\\n      betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of\\r\\n      course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me\\r\\n      thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that\\r\\n      generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble,\\r\\n      and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering\\r\\n      them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself\\r\\n      alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force\\r\\n      to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to\\r\\n      deny. But your _family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I\\r\\n      believe I thought only of _you_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short\\r\\n      pause, her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with\\r\\n      me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me\\r\\n      so at once. _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one\\r\\n      word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and\\r\\n      anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and\\r\\n      immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand\\r\\n      that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the\\r\\n      period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude\\r\\n      and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this\\r\\n      reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before;\\r\\n      and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\\r\\n      warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had\\r\\n      Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how\\r\\n      well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face,\\r\\n      became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and\\r\\n      he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she\\r\\n      was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too\\r\\n      much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any\\r\\n      other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their\\r\\n      present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_\\r\\n      call on him in her return through London, and there relate her\\r\\n      journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her\\r\\n      conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every\\r\\n      expression of the latter which, in her ladyship’s apprehension,\\r\\n      peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief\\r\\n      that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that\\r\\n      promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But,\\r\\n      unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly\\r\\n      contrariwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed\\r\\n      myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be\\r\\n      certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided\\r\\n      against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine,\\r\\n      frankly and openly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know\\r\\n      enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After\\r\\n      abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple\\r\\n      in abusing you to all your relations.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\\r\\n      accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my\\r\\n      behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It\\r\\n      was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to\\r\\n      that evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if\\r\\n      strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we\\r\\n      have both, I hope, improved in civility.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of\\r\\n      what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions\\r\\n      during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,\\r\\n      inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I\\r\\n      shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike\\r\\n      manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely\\r\\n      conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I\\r\\n      confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong\\r\\n      an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever\\r\\n      felt in such a way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every\\r\\n      proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I\\r\\n      shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed\\r\\n      you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not\\r\\n      do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily\\r\\n      ashamed of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make\\r\\n      you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit\\r\\n      to its contents?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually\\r\\n      all her former prejudices had been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it\\r\\n      was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was\\r\\n      one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your\\r\\n      having the power of reading again. I can remember some\\r\\n      expressions which might justly make you hate me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential\\r\\n      to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason\\r\\n      to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I\\r\\n      hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself\\r\\n      perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was\\r\\n      written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.\\r\\n      The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The\\r\\n      feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it,\\r\\n      are now so widely different from what they were then, that every\\r\\n      unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You\\r\\n      must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its\\r\\n      remembrance gives you pleasure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\\r\\n      retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the\\r\\n      contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is\\r\\n      much better, of innocence. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful\\r\\n      recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be\\r\\n      repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,\\r\\n      though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was\\r\\n      _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given\\r\\n      good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\\r\\n      Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), I was\\r\\n      spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,\\r\\n      particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed,\\r\\n      encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to\\r\\n      care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all\\r\\n      the rest of the world; to _wish_ at least to think meanly of\\r\\n      their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from\\r\\n      eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but\\r\\n      for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You\\r\\n      taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.\\r\\n      By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of\\r\\n      my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\\r\\n      pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you\\r\\n      to be wishing, expecting my addresses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I\\r\\n      assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might\\r\\n      often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_\\r\\n      evening?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began\\r\\n      to take a proper direction.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met\\r\\n      at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed\\r\\n      by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary\\r\\n      politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_\\r\\n      than my due.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every\\r\\n      civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the\\r\\n      past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill\\r\\n      opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended\\r\\n      to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly\\r\\n      tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and\\r\\n      of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally\\r\\n      leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that\\r\\n      his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her\\r\\n      sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his\\r\\n      gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other\\r\\n      struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\\r\\n      subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy\\r\\n      to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their\\r\\n      watches, that it was time to be at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which\\r\\n      introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted\\r\\n      with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest\\r\\n      information of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as\\r\\n      much.” And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had\\r\\n      been pretty much the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\\r\\n      confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.\\r\\n      I told him of all that had occurred to make my former\\r\\n      interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise\\r\\n      was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him,\\r\\n      moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had\\r\\n      done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could\\r\\n      easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt\\r\\n      no doubt of their happiness together.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing\\r\\n      his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you\\r\\n      told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information\\r\\n      last spring?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two\\r\\n      visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her\\r\\n      affection.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\\r\\n      conviction to him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\\r\\n      prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case,\\r\\n      but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to\\r\\n      confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended\\r\\n      him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had\\r\\n      been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and\\r\\n      purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am\\r\\n      persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your\\r\\n      sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most\\r\\n      delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\\r\\n      invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had\\r\\n      yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to\\r\\n      begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course\\r\\n      was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation\\r\\n      till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 59\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a\\r\\n      question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she\\r\\n      entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to\\r\\n      table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered\\r\\n      about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she\\r\\n      spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion\\r\\n      of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.\\r\\n      The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged\\r\\n      were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness\\r\\n      overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather\\r\\n      _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for,\\r\\n      besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils\\r\\n      before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when\\r\\n      her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him\\r\\n      but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_\\r\\n      which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\r\\n\\r\\n      At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very\\r\\n      far from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely\\r\\n      incredulous here.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No,\\r\\n      no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on\\r\\n      you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.\\r\\n      Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He\\r\\n      still loves me, and we are engaged.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know\\r\\n      how much you dislike him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot.\\r\\n      Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in\\r\\n      such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the\\r\\n      last time I shall ever remember it myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\\r\\n      seriously assured her of its truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,”\\r\\n      cried Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate\\r\\n      you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite\\r\\n      certain that you can be happy with him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already,\\r\\n      that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you\\r\\n      pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself\\r\\n      more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as\\r\\n      impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh,\\r\\n      Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you\\r\\n      quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do,\\r\\n      when I tell you all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I\\r\\n      am afraid you will be angry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very\\r\\n      seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without\\r\\n      delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\\r\\n      began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his\\r\\n      beautiful grounds at Pemberley.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\\r\\n      desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn\\r\\n      assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss\\r\\n      Bennet had nothing further to wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as\\r\\n      myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his\\r\\n      love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as\\r\\n      Bingley’s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and\\r\\n      yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very\\r\\n      reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at\\r\\n      Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,\\r\\n      not to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been\\r\\n      unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own\\r\\n      feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But\\r\\n      now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia’s\\r\\n      marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in\\r\\n      conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the\\r\\n      next morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here\\r\\n      again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so\\r\\n      tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he\\r\\n      would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us\\r\\n      with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk\\r\\n      out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;\\r\\n      yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him\\r\\n      such an epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,\\r\\n      and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good\\r\\n      information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n      have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way\\r\\n      again to-day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to\\r\\n      walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I\\r\\n      am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty\\r\\n      owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\\r\\n      curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\\r\\n      consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\n      followed her, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\\r\\n      disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind\\r\\n      it: it is all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion\\r\\n      for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put\\r\\n      yourself to inconvenience.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent\\r\\n      should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved\\r\\n      to herself the application for her mother’s. She could not\\r\\n      determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting\\r\\n      whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome\\r\\n      her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set\\r\\n      against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain\\r\\n      that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her\\r\\n      sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\\r\\n      first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\\r\\n      disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,\\r\\n      she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on\\r\\n      seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition,\\r\\n      but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be\\r\\n      through her means—that _she_, his favourite child, should be\\r\\n      distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears\\r\\n      and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and\\r\\n      she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at\\r\\n      him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he\\r\\n      approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\\r\\n      pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your\\r\\n      father, he wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\\r\\n      “Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your\\r\\n      senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been\\r\\n      more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have\\r\\n      spared her from explanations and professions which it was\\r\\n      exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she\\r\\n      assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich,\\r\\n      to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages\\r\\n      than Jane. But will they make you happy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief\\r\\n      of my indifference?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of\\r\\n      man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I\\r\\n      love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly\\r\\n      amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain\\r\\n      me by speaking of him in such terms.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the\\r\\n      kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,\\r\\n      which he condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are\\r\\n      resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of\\r\\n      it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be\\r\\n      neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your\\r\\n      husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively\\r\\n      talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal\\r\\n      marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My\\r\\n      child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to\\r\\n      respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her\\r\\n      reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was\\r\\n      really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change\\r\\n      which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute\\r\\n      certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had\\r\\n      stood the test of many months’ suspense, and enumerating with\\r\\n      energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father’s\\r\\n      incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no\\r\\n      more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not\\r\\n      have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with\\r\\n      astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every\\r\\n      thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s\\r\\n      debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will\\r\\n      save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle’s\\r\\n      doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young\\r\\n      lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him\\r\\n      to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and\\r\\n      there will be an end of the matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\\r\\n      reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some\\r\\n      time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room,\\r\\n      “If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am\\r\\n      quite at leisure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,\\r\\n      after half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was\\r\\n      able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was\\r\\n      too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away;\\r\\n      there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the\\r\\n      comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she\\r\\n      followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect\\r\\n      was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat\\r\\n      quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under\\r\\n      many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard;\\r\\n      though not in general backward to credit what was for the\\r\\n      advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to\\r\\n      any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\\r\\n      her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!\\r\\n      Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest\\r\\n      Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what\\r\\n      jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane’s is nothing to\\r\\n      it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming\\r\\n      man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for\\r\\n      my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook\\r\\n      it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is\\r\\n      charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!\\r\\n      What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\\r\\n      doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard\\r\\n      only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three\\r\\n      minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten\\r\\n      thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a Lord!\\r\\n      And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special\\r\\n      licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is\\r\\n      particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the\\r\\n      gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in\\r\\n      the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of\\r\\n      her relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished\\r\\n      for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for\\r\\n      Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law\\r\\n      that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power\\r\\n      to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his\\r\\n      opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains\\r\\n      to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that\\r\\n      he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham,\\r\\n      perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband\\r\\n      quite as well as Jane’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 60\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.\\r\\n      “How could you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on\\r\\n      charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could\\r\\n      set you off in the first place?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\\r\\n      words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in\\r\\n      the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my\\r\\n      behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil,\\r\\n      and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain\\r\\n      than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little\\r\\n      less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference,\\r\\n      of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who\\r\\n      were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_\\r\\n      approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so\\r\\n      unlike _them_. Had you not been really amiable, you would have\\r\\n      hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise\\r\\n      yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your\\r\\n      heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\\r\\n      courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for\\r\\n      it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it\\r\\n      perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of\\r\\n      me—but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\\r\\n      she was ill at Netherfield?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a\\r\\n      virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your\\r\\n      protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;\\r\\n      and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing\\r\\n      and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin\\r\\n      directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the\\r\\n      point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called,\\r\\n      and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did\\r\\n      you look as if you did not care about me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\\r\\n      encouragement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “But I was embarrassed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And so was I.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “A man who had felt less, might.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\\r\\n      and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder\\r\\n      how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to\\r\\n      yourself. I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not\\r\\n      asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to\\r\\n      Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too much_, I am afraid; for\\r\\n      what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach\\r\\n      of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This\\r\\n      will never do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly\\r\\n      fair. Lady Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us\\r\\n      were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for\\r\\n      my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your\\r\\n      gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of\\r\\n      yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope, and I was\\r\\n      determined at once to know every thing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her\\r\\n      happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come\\r\\n      down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and\\r\\n      be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious\\r\\n      consequence?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could,\\r\\n      whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or\\r\\n      what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were\\r\\n      still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession\\r\\n      to him which I have since made.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what\\r\\n      is to befall her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I am more likely to want  time than courage, Elizabeth. But it\\r\\n      ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it\\r\\n      shall be done directly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      “And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\\r\\n      and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady\\r\\n      once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer\\r\\n      neglected.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.\\r\\n      Gardiner’s long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate\\r\\n      which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to\\r\\n      find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of\\r\\n      happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to\\r\\n      have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\\r\\n      particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You\\r\\n      supposed more than really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as\\r\\n      you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your\\r\\n      imagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\r\\n      afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot\\r\\n      greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\r\\n      great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and\\r\\n      again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to\\r\\n      wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round\\r\\n      the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world.\\r\\n      Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such\\r\\n      justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare\\r\\n      from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours,\\r\\n      etc.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;\\r\\n      and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr.\\r\\n      Collins, in reply to his last.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Dear Sir,\\r\\n      “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will\\r\\n      soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as\\r\\n      you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has\\r\\n      more to give.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yours sincerely, etc.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\\r\\n      marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote\\r\\n      even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat\\r\\n      all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but\\r\\n      she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could\\r\\n      not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was\\r\\n      deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar\\r\\n      information, was as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four\\r\\n      sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and\\r\\n      all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any\\r\\n      congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family\\r\\n      heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The\\r\\n      reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine\\r\\n      had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her\\r\\n      nephew’s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match,\\r\\n      was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a\\r\\n      moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to\\r\\n      Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must\\r\\n      sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.\\r\\n      Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\\r\\n      husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could\\r\\n      even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on\\r\\n      carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed\\r\\n      his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James’s, with\\r\\n      very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not\\r\\n      till Sir William was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mrs. Phillips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax\\r\\n      on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her\\r\\n      sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the\\r\\n      familiarity which Bingley’s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever\\r\\n      she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him,\\r\\n      though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more\\r\\n      elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the\\r\\n      frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to\\r\\n      herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\\r\\n      without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\n      arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of\\r\\n      its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked\\r\\n      forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from\\r\\n      society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and\\r\\n      elegance of their family party at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 61\\r\\n\\r\\n      Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what\\r\\n      delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked\\r\\n      of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake\\r\\n      of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in\\r\\n      the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an\\r\\n      effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman\\r\\n      for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her\\r\\n      husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so\\r\\n      unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and\\r\\n      invariably silly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection\\r\\n      for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.\\r\\n      He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least\\r\\n      expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.\\r\\n      So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not\\r\\n      desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.\\r\\n      The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an\\r\\n      estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and\\r\\n      Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were\\r\\n      within thirty miles of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\\r\\n      time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what\\r\\n      she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not\\r\\n      of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the\\r\\n      influence of Lydia’s example, she became, by proper attention and\\r\\n      management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From\\r\\n      the further disadvantage of Lydia’s society she was of course\\r\\n      carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to\\r\\n      come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men,\\r\\n      her father would never consent to her going.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\\r\\n      necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.\\r\\n      Bennet’s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix\\r\\n      more with the world, but she could still moralize over every\\r\\n      morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons\\r\\n      between her sisters’ beauty and her own, it was suspected by her\\r\\n      father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution\\r\\n      from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the\\r\\n      conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with\\r\\n      whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown\\r\\n      to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope\\r\\n      that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The\\r\\n      congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her\\r\\n      marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by\\r\\n      himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this\\r\\n      effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n      “My dear Lizzy,\\r\\n      “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my\\r\\n      dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to\\r\\n      have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope\\r\\n      you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at\\r\\n      court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money\\r\\n      enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of\\r\\n      about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to\\r\\n      Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\r\\n\\r\\n      “Yours, etc.”\\r\\n\\r\\n      As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she\\r\\n      endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and\\r\\n      expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her\\r\\n      power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy\\r\\n      in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had\\r\\n      always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under\\r\\n      the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and\\r\\n      heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their\\r\\n      support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\\r\\n      herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance\\r\\n      towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even\\r\\n      when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was\\r\\n      unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to\\r\\n      place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more\\r\\n      than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into\\r\\n      indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her\\r\\n      youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation\\r\\n      which her marriage had given her.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him further in his profession.\\r\\n      Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone\\r\\n      to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they\\r\\n      both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley’s good\\r\\n      humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of\\r\\n      giving them a hint to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but\\r\\n      as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at\\r\\n      Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of\\r\\n      Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid\\r\\n      off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the\\r\\n      sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able\\r\\n      to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had\\r\\n      the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first\\r\\n      she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her\\r\\n      lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had\\r\\n      always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her\\r\\n      affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind\\r\\n      received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By\\r\\n      Elizabeth’s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman\\r\\n      may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not\\r\\n      always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than\\r\\n      himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\\r\\n      nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her\\r\\n      character in her reply to the letter which announced its\\r\\n      arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of\\r\\n      Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But\\r\\n      at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion, he was prevailed on to\\r\\n      overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a\\r\\n      little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment\\r\\n      gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to\\r\\n      see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait\\r\\n      on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods\\r\\n      had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress,\\r\\n      but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.\\r\\n      Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were\\r\\n      both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons\\r\\n      who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of\\r\\n      uniting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

              "'          It is a truth universally acknowledged  that a single man in        possession of a good fortune  must be in want of a wife           However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be        on his first entering a neighbourhood  this truth is so well        fixed in the minds of the surrounding families  that he is        considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their        daughters            My dear Mr  Bennet   said his lady to him one day   have you        heard that Netherfield Park is let at last            Mr  Bennet replied that he had not            But it is   returned she   for Mrs  Long has just been here  and        she told me all about it            Mr  Bennet made no answer            Do not you want to know who has taken it   cried his wife        impatiently             You  want to tell me  and I have no objection to hearing it            This was invitation enough            Why  my dear  you must know  Mrs  Long says that Netherfield is        taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England         that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the        place  and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr         Morris immediately  that he is to take possession before        Michaelmas  and some of his servants are to be in the house by        the end of next week             What is his name             Bingley             Is he married or single             Oh  single  my dear  to be sure  A single man of large fortune         four or five thousand a year  What a fine thing for our girls             How so  how can it affect them             My dear Mr  Bennet   replied his wife   how can you be so        tiresome  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of        them             Is that his design in settling here             Design  nonsense  how can you talk so  But it is very likely        that he  may  fall in love with one of them  and therefore you        must visit him as soon as he comes             I see no occasion for that  You and the girls may go  or you may        send them by themselves  which perhaps will be still better  for        as you are as handsome as any of them  Mr  Bingley might like you        the best of the party             My dear  you flatter me  I certainly  have  had my share of        beauty  but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now         When a woman has five grown up daughters  she ought to give over        thinking of her own beauty             In such cases  a woman has not often much beauty to think of             But  my dear  you must indeed go and see Mr  Bingley when he        comes into the neighbourhood             It is more than I engage for  I assure you             But consider your daughters  Only think what an establishment it        would be for one of them  Sir William and Lady Lucas are        determined to go  merely on that account  for in general  you        know  they visit no newcomers  Indeed you must go  for it will be        impossible for  us  to visit him  if you do not             You are over scrupulous  surely  I dare say Mr  Bingley will be        very glad to see you  and I will send a few lines by you to        assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he        chooses of the girls  though I must throw in a good word for my        little Lizzy             I desire you will do no such thing  Lizzy is not a bit better        than the others  and I am sure she is not half so handsome as        Jane  nor half so good humoured as Lydia  But you are always        giving  her  the preference             They have none of them much to recommend them   replied he          they are all silly and ignorant like other girls  but Lizzy has        something more of quickness than her sisters             Mr  Bennet  how can you abuse your own children in such a way         You take delight in vexing me  You have no compassion on my poor        nerves             You mistake me  my dear  I have a high respect for your nerves         They are my old friends  I have heard you mention them with        consideration these twenty years at least             Ah  you do not know what I suffer             But I hope you will get over it  and live to see many young men        of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood             It will be no use to us  if twenty such should come  since you        will not visit them             Depend upon it  my dear  that when there are twenty  I will        visit them all            Mr  Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts  sarcastic humour         reserve  and caprice  that the experience of three and twenty        years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his        character   Her  mind was less difficult to develop  She was a        woman of mean understanding  little information  and uncertain        temper  When she was discontented  she fancied herself nervous         The business of her life was to get her daughters married  its        solace was visiting and news           Chapter 2          Mr  Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr         Bingley  He had always intended to visit him  though to the last        always assuring his wife that he should not go  and till the        evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it  It        was then disclosed in the following manner  Observing his second        daughter employed in trimming a hat  he suddenly addressed her        with            I hope Mr  Bingley will like it  Lizzy             We are not in a way to know  what  Mr  Bingley likes   said her        mother resentfully   since we are not to visit             But you forget  mamma   said Elizabeth   that we shall meet him        at the assemblies  and that Mrs  Long has promised to introduce him             I do not believe Mrs  Long will do any such thing  She has two        nieces of her own  She is a selfish  hypocritical woman  and I        have no opinion of her             No more have I   said Mr  Bennet   and I am glad to find that        you do not depend on her serving you            Mrs  Bennet deigned not to make any reply  but  unable to contain        herself  began scolding one of her daughters            Don t keep coughing so  Kitty  for heaven s sake  Have a little        compassion on my nerves  You tear them to pieces             Kitty has no discretion in her coughs   said her father   she        times them ill             I do not cough for my own amusement   replied Kitty fretfully          When is your next ball to be  Lizzy             To morrow fortnight             Aye  so it is   cried her mother   and Mrs  Long does not come        back till the day before  so  it will be impossible for her to        introduce him  for she will not know him herself             Then  my dear  you may have the advantage of your friend  and        introduce Mr  Bingley to  her              Impossible  Mr  Bennet  impossible  when I am not acquainted        with him myself  how can you be so teasing             I honour your circumspection  A fortnight s acquaintance is        certainly very little  One cannot know what a man really is by        the end of a fortnight  But if  we  do not venture somebody else        will  and after all  Mrs  Long and her nieces must stand their        chance  and  therefore  as she will think it an act of kindness         if you decline the office  I will take it on myself            The girls stared at their father  Mrs  Bennet said only          Nonsense  nonsense             What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation   cried he          Do you consider the forms of introduction  and the stress that        is laid on them  as nonsense  I cannot quite agree with you         there   What say you  Mary  for you are a young lady of deep        reflection  I know  and read great books and make extracts            Mary wished to say something very sensible  but knew not how            While Mary is adjusting her ideas   he continued   let us return        to Mr  Bingley             I am sick of Mr  Bingley   cried his wife            I am sorry to hear  that   but why did not you tell me so        before  If I had known as much this morning  I certainly would not        have called on him  It is very unlucky  but as I have actually        paid the visit  we cannot escape the acquaintance now            The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished  that of        Mrs  Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest  though when the first        tumult of joy was over  she began to declare that it was what she        had expected all the while            How good it was in you  my dear Mr  Bennet  But I knew I should        persuade you at last  I was sure you loved your girls too well to        neglect such an acquaintance  Well  how pleased I am  and it is        such a good joke  too  that you should have gone this morning  and        never said a word about it till now             Now  Kitty  you may cough as much as you choose   said Mr         Bennet  and  as he spoke  he left the room  fatigued with the        raptures of his wife            What an excellent father you have  girls   said she  when the        door was shut   I do not know how you will ever make him amends        for his kindness  or me either  for that matter  At our time of        life  it is not so pleasant  I can tell you  to be making new        acquaintance every day  but for your sakes  we would do        anything  Lydia  my love  though you  are  the youngest  I dare        say Mr  Bingley will dance with you at the next ball             Oh   said Lydia stoutly   I am not afraid  for though I  am  the        youngest  I m the tallest            The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he        would return Mr  Bennet s visit  and determining when they should        ask him to dinner           Chapter 3          Not all that Mrs  Bennet  however  with the assistance of her        five daughters  could ask on the subject  was sufficient to draw        from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr  Bingley         They attacked him in various ways  with barefaced questions         ingenious suppositions  and distant surmises  but he eluded the        skill of them all  and they were at last obliged to accept the        second hand intelligence of their neighbour  Lady Lucas  Her        report was highly favourable  Sir William had been delighted with        him  He was quite young  wonderfully handsome  extremely        agreeable  and  to crown the whole  he meant to be at the next        assembly with a large party  Nothing could be more delightful  To        be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love         and very lively hopes of Mr  Bingley s heart were entertained            If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at        Netherfield   said Mrs  Bennet to her husband   and all the        others equally well married  I shall have nothing to wish for            In a few days Mr  Bingley returned Mr  Bennet s visit  and sat        about ten minutes with him in his library  He had entertained        hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies  of whose        beauty he had heard much  but he saw only the father  The ladies        were somewhat more fortunate  for they had the advantage of        ascertaining from an upper window  that he wore a blue coat and        rode a black horse           An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched  and        already had Mrs  Bennet planned the courses that were to do        credit to her housekeeping  when an answer arrived which deferred        it all  Mr  Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day         and consequently unable to accept the honour of their        invitation  etc  Mrs  Bennet was quite disconcerted  She could        not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his        arrival in Hertfordshire  and she began to fear that he might be        always flying about from one place to another  and never settled        at Netherfield as he ought to be  Lady Lucas quieted her fears a        little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to        get a large party for the ball  and a report soon followed that        Mr  Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with        him to the assembly  The girls grieved over such a number of        ladies  but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing         that instead of twelve  he had brought only six with him from        London  his five sisters and a cousin  And when the party entered        the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether  Mr         Bingley  his two sisters  the husband of the eldest  and another        young man           Mr  Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike  he had a pleasant        countenance  and easy  unaffected manners  His sisters were fine        women  with an air of decided fashion  His brother in law  Mr         Hurst  merely looked the gentleman  but his friend Mr  Darcy soon        drew the attention of the room by his fine  tall person  handsome        features  noble mien  and the report which was in general        circulation within five minutes after his entrance  of his having        ten thousand a year  The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine        figure of a man  the ladies declared he was much handsomer than        Mr  Bingley  and he was looked at with great admiration for about        half the evening  till his manners gave a disgust which turned        the tide of his popularity  for he was discovered to be proud  to        be above his company  and above being pleased  and not all his        large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most        forbidding  disagreeable countenance  and being unworthy to be        compared with his friend           Mr  Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the        principal people in the room  he was lively and unreserved         danced every dance  was angry that the ball closed so early  and        talked of giving one himself at Netherfield  Such amiable        qualities must speak for themselves  What a contrast between him        and his friend  Mr  Darcy danced only once with Mrs  Hurst and        once with Miss Bingley  declined being introduced to any other        lady  and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the        room  speaking occasionally to one of his own party  His        character was decided  He was the proudest  most disagreeable man        in the world  and everybody hoped that he would never come there        again  Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs  Bennet         whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into        particular resentment by his having slighted one of her        daughters           Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged  by the scarcity of gentlemen         to sit down for two dances  and during part of that time  Mr         Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a        conversation between him and Mr  Bingley  who came from the dance        for a few minutes  to press his friend to join it            Come  Darcy   said he   I must have you dance  I hate to see you        standing about by yourself in this stupid manner  You had much        better dance             I certainly shall not  You know how I detest it  unless I am        particularly acquainted with my partner  At such an assembly as        this  it would be insupportable  Your sisters are engaged  and        there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a        punishment to me to stand up with             I would not be so fastidious as you are   cried Bingley          for a kingdom  Upon my honour  I never met with so many pleasant        girls in my life as I have this evening  and there are several of        them you see uncommonly pretty              You  are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room   said        Mr  Darcy  looking at the eldest Miss Bennet            Oh  she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld  But there        is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you  who is very        pretty  and I dare say very agreeable  Do let me ask my partner        to introduce you             Which do you mean   and turning round  he looked for a moment at        Elizabeth  till catching her eye  he withdrew his own and coldly        said   She is tolerable  but not handsome enough to tempt  me   and I        am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies        who are slighted by other men  You had better return to your        partner and enjoy her smiles  for you are wasting your time with        me            Mr  Bingley followed his advice  Mr  Darcy walked off  and        Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him  She        told the story  however  with great spirit among her friends  for        she had a lively  playful disposition  which delighted in        anything ridiculous           The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family         Mrs  Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the        Netherfield party  Mr  Bingley had danced with her twice  and she        had been distinguished by his sisters  Jane was as much gratified        by this as her mother could be  though in a quieter way         Elizabeth felt Jane s pleasure  Mary had heard herself mentioned        to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the        neighbourhood  and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough        to be never without partners  which was all that they had yet        learnt to care for at a ball  They returned  therefore  in good        spirits to Longbourn  the village where they lived  and of which        they were the principal inhabitants  They found Mr  Bennet still        up  With a book he was regardless of time  and on the present        occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an        evening which had raised such splendid expectations  He had        rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be        disappointed  but he soon found that he had a very different story        to hear            Oh  my dear Mr  Bennet   as she entered the room   we have had a        most delightful evening  a most excellent ball  I wish you had        been there  Jane was so admired  nothing could be like it         Everybody said how well she looked  and Mr  Bingley thought her        quite beautiful  and danced with her twice  Only think of  that          my dear  he actually danced with her twice  and she was the only        creature in the room that he asked a second time  First of all         he asked Miss Lucas  I was so vexed to see him stand up with her         but  however  he did not admire her at all  indeed  nobody can         you know  and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going        down the dance  So he enquired who she was  and got introduced         and asked her for the two next  Then  the two third he danced with        Miss King  and the two fourth with Maria Lucas  and the two fifth        with Jane again  and the two sixth with Lizzy  and the         Boulanger              If he had had any compassion for  me    cried her husband        impatiently   he would not have danced half so much  For God s        sake  say no more of his partners  Oh that he had sprained his        ankle in the first dance             Oh  my dear   continued Mrs  Bennet   I am quite delighted with him  He is so excessively        handsome  and his sisters are charming women  I never in my life        saw anything more elegant than their dresses  I dare say the lace        upon Mrs  Hurst s gown            Here she was interrupted again  Mr  Bennet protested against any        description of finery  She was therefore obliged to seek another        branch of the subject  and related  with much bitterness of        spirit and some exaggeration  the shocking rudeness of Mr  Darcy            But I can assure you   she added   that Lizzy does not lose much        by not suiting  his  fancy  for he is a most disagreeable  horrid        man  not at all worth pleasing  So high and so conceited that        there was no enduring him  He walked here  and he walked there         fancying himself so very great  Not handsome enough to dance        with  I wish you had been there  my dear  to have given him one        of your set downs  I quite detest the man            Chapter 4          When Jane and Elizabeth were alone  the former  who had been        cautious in her praise of Mr  Bingley before  expressed to her        sister how very much she admired him            He is just what a young man ought to be   said she   sensible         good humoured  lively  and I never saw such happy manners  so        much ease  with such perfect good breeding             He is also handsome   replied Elizabeth   which a young man        ought likewise to be  if he possibly can  His character is        thereby complete             I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second        time  I did not expect such a compliment             Did not you   I  did for you  But that is one great difference        between us  Compliments always take  you  by surprise  and  me         never  What could be more natural than his asking you again  He        could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as        every other woman in the room  No thanks to his gallantry for        that  Well  he certainly is very agreeable  and I give you leave        to like him  You have liked many a stupider person             Dear Lizzy             Oh  you are a great deal too apt  you know  to like people in        general  You never see a fault in anybody  All the world are good        and agreeable in your eyes  I never heard you speak ill of a        human being in my life             I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one  but I always        speak what I think             I know you do  and it is  that  which makes the wonder  With         your  good sense  to be so honestly blind to the follies and        nonsense of others  Affectation of candour is common enough  one        meets with it everywhere  But to be candid without ostentation or        design to take the good of everybody s character and make it        still better  and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone         And so  you like this man s sisters  too  do you  Their manners        are not equal to his             Certainly not  at first  But they are very pleasing women when        you converse with them  Miss Bingley is to live with her brother         and keep his house  and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a        very charming neighbour in her            Elizabeth listened in silence  but was not convinced  their        behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in        general  and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy        of temper than her sister  and with a judgment too unassailed by        any attention to herself  she was very little disposed to approve        them  They were in fact very fine ladies  not deficient in good        humour when they were pleased  nor in the power of        being agreeable where they chose it  but proud and conceited         They were rather handsome  had been educated in one of the first        private seminaries in town  had a fortune of twenty thousand        pounds  were in the habit of spending more than they ought  and        of associating with people of rank  and were therefore in every        respect entitled to think well of themselves  and meanly of        others  They were of a respectable family in the north of        England  a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories        than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired        by trade           Mr  Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred        thousand pounds from his father  who had intended to purchase an        estate  but did not live to do it  Mr  Bingley intended it        likewise  and sometimes made choice of his county  but as he was        now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor  it was        doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his        temper  whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at        Netherfield  and leave the next generation to purchase           His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own         but though he was now established only as a tenant  Miss Bingley        was by no means unwilling to preside at his table  nor was Mrs         Hurst  who had married a man of more fashion than fortune  less        disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her         Mr  Bingley had not been of age two years  when he was tempted by        an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House  He did        look at it  and into it for half an hour  was pleased with the        situation and the principal rooms  satisfied with what the owner        said in its praise  and took it immediately           Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship  in        spite of great opposition of character  Bingley was endeared to        Darcy by the easiness  openness  and ductility of his temper         though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own         and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied  On the        strength of Darcy s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance  and        of his judgment the highest opinion  In understanding  Darcy was        the superior  Bingley was by no means deficient  but Darcy was        clever  He was at the same time haughty  reserved  and        fastidious  and his manners  though well bred  were not inviting         In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage  Bingley was        sure of being liked wherever he appeared  Darcy was continually        giving offence           The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was        sufficiently characteristic  Bingley had never met with        pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life  everybody had been        most kind and attentive to him  there had been no formality  no        stiffness  he had soon felt acquainted with all the room  and as        to Miss Bennet  he could not conceive an angel more beautiful         Darcy  on the contrary  had seen a collection of people in whom        there was little beauty and no fashion  for none of whom he had        felt the smallest interest  and from none received either        attention or pleasure  Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty         but she smiled too much           Mrs  Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they        admired her and liked her  and pronounced her to be a sweet girl         and one whom they should not object to know more of  Miss Bennet        was therefore established as a sweet girl  and their brother felt        authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose           Chapter 5          Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the        Bennets were particularly intimate  Sir William Lucas had been        formerly in trade in Meryton  where he had made a tolerable        fortune  and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to        the king during his mayoralty  The distinction had perhaps been        felt too strongly  It had given him a disgust to his business        and to his residence in a small market town  and  quitting        them both  he had removed with his family to a house about a mile        from Meryton  denominated from that period Lucas Lodge  where he        could think with pleasure of his own importance  and  unshackled        by business  occupy himself solely in being civil to all the        world  For  though elated by his rank  it did not render him        supercilious  on the contrary  he was all attention to everybody         By nature inoffensive  friendly  and obliging  his presentation        at St  James s had made him courteous           Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman  not too clever to be a        valuable neighbour to Mrs  Bennet  They had several children  The        eldest of them  a sensible  intelligent young woman  about        twenty seven  was Elizabeth s intimate friend           That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk        over a ball was absolutely necessary  and the morning after the        assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to        communicate             You  began the evening well  Charlotte   said Mrs  Bennet with        civil self command to Miss Lucas    You  were Mr  Bingley s first        choice             Yes  but he seemed to like his second better             Oh  you mean Jane  I suppose  because he danced with her twice         To be sure that  did  seem as if he admired her indeed I rather        believe he  did  I heard something about it but I hardly know        what something about Mr  Robinson             Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr  Robinson         did not I mention it to you  Mr  Robinson s asking him how he        liked our Meryton assemblies  and whether he did not think there        were a great many pretty women in the room  and  which  he        thought the prettiest  and his answering immediately to the last        question  Oh  the eldest Miss Bennet  beyond a doubt  there        cannot be two opinions on that point              Upon my word  Well  that was very decided indeed that does seem        as if but  however  it may all come to nothing  you know              My  overhearings were more to the purpose than  yours   Eliza          said Charlotte   Mr  Darcy is not so well worth listening to as        his friend  is he  Poor Eliza  to be only just  tolerable              I beg you would not put it into Lizzy s head to be vexed by his        ill treatment  for he is such a disagreeable man that it would        be quite a misfortune to be liked by him  Mrs  Long told me last        night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once        opening his lips             Are you quite sure  ma am  is not there a little mistake   said        Jane   I certainly saw Mr  Darcy speaking to her             Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield  and        he could not help answering her  but she said he seemed very        angry at being spoke to             Miss Bingley told me   said Jane   that he never speaks much        unless among his intimate acquaintance  With  them  he is        remarkably agreeable             I do not believe a word of it  my dear  If he had been so very        agreeable  he would have talked to Mrs  Long  But I can guess how        it was  everybody says that he is eat up with pride  and I dare        say he had heard somehow that Mrs  Long does not keep a carriage         and had come to the ball in a hack chaise             I do not mind his not talking to Mrs  Long   said Miss Lucas          but I wish he had danced with Eliza             Another time  Lizzy   said her mother   I would not dance with         him   if I were you             I believe  ma am  I may safely promise you  never  to dance with        him             His pride   said Miss Lucas   does not offend  me  so much as        pride often does  because there is an excuse for it  One cannot        wonder that so very fine a young man  with family  fortune         everything in his favour  should think highly of himself  If I        may so express it  he has a  right  to be proud             That is very true   replied Elizabeth   and I could easily        forgive  his  pride  if he had not mortified  mine              Pride   observed Mary  who piqued herself upon the solidity of        her reflections   is a very common failing  I believe  By all        that I have ever read  I am convinced that it is very common        indeed  that human nature is particularly prone to it  and that        there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of        self complacency on the score of some quality or other  real or        imaginary  Vanity and pride are different things  though the        words are often used synonymously  A person may be proud without        being vain  Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves         vanity to what we would have others think of us             If I were as rich as Mr  Darcy   cried a young Lucas  who came        with his sisters   I should not care how proud I was  I would        keep a pack of foxhounds  and drink a bottle of wine every day             Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought   said        Mrs  Bennet   and if I were to see you at it  I should take away        your bottle directly            The boy protested that she should not  she continued to declare        that she would  and the argument ended only with the visit           Chapter 6          The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield  The        visit was returned in due form  Miss Bennet s pleasing        manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley  and        though the mother was found to be intolerable  and the younger        sisters not worth speaking to  a wish of being better acquainted        with  them  was expressed towards the two eldest  By Jane this        attention was received with the greatest pleasure  but Elizabeth        still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody         hardly excepting even her sister  and could not like them  though        their kindness to Jane  such as it was  had a value as arising in        all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration         It was generally evident whenever they met  that he  did  admire        her  and to  her  it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to        the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the        first  and was in a way to be very much in love  but she        considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered        by the world in general  since Jane united with great strength        of feeling  a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of        manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the        impertinent  She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas            It may perhaps be pleasant   replied Charlotte   to be able to        impose on the public in such a case  but it is sometimes a        disadvantage to be so very guarded  If a woman conceals her        affection with the same skill from the object of it  she may lose        the opportunity of fixing him  and it will then be but poor        consolation to believe the world equally in the dark  There is so        much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment  that it        is not safe to leave any to itself  We can all  begin  freely a        slight preference is natural enough  but there are very few of us        who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement         In nine cases out of ten  a woman had better show  more  affection        than she feels  Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly  but he may        never do more than like her  if she does not help him on             But she does help him on  as much as her nature will allow  If         I  can perceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton        indeed not to discover it too             Remember  Eliza  that he does not know Jane s disposition as you        do             But if a woman is partial to a man  and does not endeavour to        conceal it  he must find it out             Perhaps he must  if he sees enough of her  But though Bingley        and Jane meet tolerably often  it is never for many hours        together  and as they always see each other in large mixed        parties  it is impossible that every moment should be employed in        conversing together  Jane should therefore make the most of every        half hour in which she can command his attention  When she is        secure of him  there will be leisure for falling in love as        much as she chooses             Your plan is a good one   replied Elizabeth   where nothing is        in question but the desire of being well married  and if I were        determined to get a rich husband  or any husband  I dare say I        should adopt it  But these are not Jane s feelings  she is not        acting by design  As yet  she cannot even be certain of the        degree of her own regard  nor of its reasonableness  She has known        him only a fortnight  She danced four dances with him at Meryton         she saw him one morning at his own house  and has since dined        in company with him four times  This is not quite enough to make        her understand his character             Not as you represent it  Had she merely  dined  with him  she        might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite  but        you must remember that four evenings have been also spent        together and four evenings may do a great deal             Yes  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that        they both like Vingt un better than Commerce  but with respect to        any other leading characteristic  I do not imagine that much has        been unfolded             Well   said Charlotte   I wish Jane success with all my heart         and if she were married to him to morrow  I should think she had        as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his        character for a twelvemonth  Happiness in marriage is entirely a        matter of chance  If the dispositions of the parties are ever so        well known to each other  or ever so similar beforehand  it does        not advance their felicity in the least  They always continue to        grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of        vexation  and it is better to know as little as possible of the        defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life             You make me laugh  Charlotte  but it is not sound  You know it        is not sound  and that you would never act in this way yourself            Occupied in observing Mr  Bingley s attentions to her sister         Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming        an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend  Mr  Darcy        had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty  he had looked at        her without admiration at the ball  and when they next met  he        looked at her only to criticise  But no sooner had he made it        clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good        feature in her face  than he began to find it was rendered        uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark        eyes  To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying         Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure        of perfect symmetry in her form  he was forced to acknowledge her        figure to be light and pleasing  and in spite of his asserting        that her manners were not those of the fashionable world  he was        caught by their easy playfulness  Of this she was perfectly        unaware  to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable        nowhere  and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance        with           He began to wish to know more of her  and as a step towards        conversing with her himself  attended to her conversation with        others  His doing so drew her notice  It was at Sir William        Lucas s  where a large party were assembled            What does Mr  Darcy mean   said she to Charlotte   by listening        to my conversation with Colonel Forster             That is a question which Mr  Darcy only can answer             But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I        see what he is about  He has a very satirical eye  and if I do        not begin by being impertinent myself  I shall soon grow afraid        of him            On his approaching them soon afterwards  though without seeming        to have any intention of speaking  Miss Lucas defied her friend        to mention such a subject to him  which immediately provoking        Elizabeth to do it  she turned to him and said            Did not you think  Mr  Darcy  that I expressed myself uncommonly        well just now  when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a        ball at Meryton             With great energy  but it is a subject which always makes a lady        energetic             You are severe on us             It will be  her  turn soon to be teased   said Miss Lucas   I am        going to open the instrument  Eliza  and you know what follows             You are a very strange creature by way of a friend  always        wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody  If my        vanity had taken a musical turn  you would have been invaluable         but as it is  I would really rather not sit down before those who        must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers   On        Miss Lucas s persevering  however  she added   Very well  if it        must be so  it must   And gravely glancing at Mr  Darcy   There        is a fine old saying  which everybody here is of course familiar        with  Keep your breath to cool your porridge   and I shall keep        mine to swell my song            Her performance was pleasing  though by no means capital  After a        song or two  and before she could reply to the entreaties of        several that she would sing again  she was eagerly succeeded at        the instrument by her sister Mary  who having  in consequence of        being the only plain one in the family  worked hard for knowledge        and accomplishments  was always impatient for display           Mary had neither genius nor taste  and though vanity had given        her application  it had given her likewise a pedantic air and        conceited manner  which would have injured a higher degree of        excellence than she had reached  Elizabeth  easy and unaffected         had been listened to with much more pleasure  though not playing        half so well  and Mary  at the end of a long concerto  was glad        to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs  at the        request of her younger sisters  who with some of the Lucases         and two or three officers  joined eagerly in dancing at one end        of the room           Mr  Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of        passing the evening  to the exclusion of all conversation  and        was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir        William Lucas was his neighbour  till Sir William thus began            What a charming amusement for young people this is  Mr  Darcy         There is nothing like dancing after all  I consider it as one of        the first refinements of polished societies             Certainly  sir  and it has the advantage also of being in vogue        amongst the less polished societies of the world  Every savage        can dance            Sir William only smiled   Your friend performs delightfully   he        continued after a pause  on seeing Bingley join the group   and I        doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself  Mr         Darcy             You saw me dance at Meryton  I believe  sir             Yes  indeed  and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the        sight  Do you often dance at St  James s             Never  sir             Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place             It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid        it             You have a house in town  I conclude            Mr  Darcy bowed            I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am        fond of superior society  but I did not feel quite certain that        the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas            He paused in hopes of an answer  but his companion was not        disposed to make any  and Elizabeth at that instant moving        towards them  he was struck with the notion of doing a very        gallant thing  and called out to her            My dear Miss Eliza  why are not you dancing  Mr  Darcy  you must        allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable        partner  You cannot refuse to dance  I am sure  when so much        beauty is before you   And  taking her hand  he would have given        it to Mr  Darcy  who  though extremely surprised  was not        unwilling to receive it  when she instantly drew back  and said        with some discomposure to Sir William            Indeed  sir  I have not the least intention of dancing  I        entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg        for a partner            Mr  Darcy  with grave propriety  requested to be allowed the        honour of her hand  but in vain  Elizabeth was determined  nor        did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at        persuasion            You excel so much in the dance  Miss Eliza  that it is cruel to        deny me the happiness of seeing you  and though this gentleman        dislikes the amusement in general  he can have no objection  I am        sure  to oblige us for one half hour             Mr  Darcy is all politeness   said Elizabeth  smiling            He is  indeed but  considering the inducement  my dear Miss        Eliza  we cannot wonder at his complaisance  for who would object        to such a partner            Elizabeth looked archly  and turned away  Her resistance had not        injured her with the gentleman  and he was thinking of her with        some complacency  when thus accosted by Miss Bingley            I can guess the subject of your reverie             I should imagine not             You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many        evenings in this manner in such society  and indeed I am quite of        your opinion  I was never more annoyed  The insipidity  and yet        the noise  the nothingness  and yet the self importance of all        these people  What would I give to hear your strictures on them             Your conjecture is totally wrong  I assure you  My mind was more        agreeably engaged  I have been meditating on the very great        pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman        can bestow            Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face  and desired        he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such        reflections  Mr  Darcy replied with great intrepidity            Miss Elizabeth Bennet             Miss Elizabeth Bennet   repeated Miss Bingley   I am all        astonishment  How long has she been such a favourite  and pray        when am I to wish you joy             That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask  A        lady s imagination is very rapid  it jumps from admiration to        love  from love to matrimony  in a moment  I knew you would be        wishing me joy             Nay  if you are so serious about it  I shall consider the matter as        absolutely settled  You will have a charming mother in law         indeed  and of course she will be always at Pemberley with        you            He listened to her with perfect indifference  while she chose to        entertain herself in this manner  and as his composure convinced        her that all was safe  her wit flowed long           Chapter 7          Mr  Bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of        two thousand a year  which  unfortunately for his daughters  was        entailed  in default of heirs male  on a distant relation  and        their mother s fortune  though ample for her situation in life         could but ill supply the deficiency of his  Her father had been        an attorney in Meryton  and had left her four thousand pounds           She had a sister married to a Mr  Phillips  who had been a clerk        to their father  and succeeded him in the business  and a brother        settled in London in a respectable line of trade           The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton  a most        convenient distance for the young ladies  who were usually        tempted thither three or four times a week  to pay their duty to        their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way  The two        youngest of the family  Catherine and Lydia  were particularly        frequent in these attentions  their minds were more vacant than        their sisters   and when nothing better offered  a walk to        Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish        conversation for the evening  and however bare of news the        country in general might be  they always contrived to learn some        from their aunt  At present  indeed  they were well supplied both        with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia        regiment in the neighbourhood  it was to remain the whole winter         and Meryton was the headquarters           Their visits to Mrs  Philips were now productive of the most        interesting intelligence  Every day added something to their        knowledge of the officers  names and connections  Their lodgings        were not long a secret  and at length they began to know the        officers themselves  Mr  Philips visited them all  and this        opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before  They        could talk of nothing but officers  and Mr  Bingley s large        fortune  the mention of which gave animation to their mother  was        worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an        ensign           After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject         Mr  Bennet coolly observed            From all that I can collect by your manner of talking  you must        be two of the silliest girls in the country  I have suspected it        some time  but I am now convinced            Catherine was disconcerted  and made no answer  but Lydia  with        perfect indifference  continued to express her admiration of        Captain Carter  and her hope of seeing him in the course of the        day  as he was going the next morning to London            I am astonished  my dear   said Mrs  Bennet   that you should be        so ready to think your own children silly  If I wished to think        slightingly of anybody s children  it should not be of my own         however             If my children are silly  I must hope to be always sensible of        it             Yes but as it happens  they are all of them very clever             This is the only point  I flatter myself  on which we do not        agree  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every        particular  but I must so far differ from you as to think our two        youngest daughters uncommonly foolish             My dear Mr  Bennet  you must not expect such girls to have the        sense of their father and mother  When they get to our age  I        dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do         I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and         indeed  so I do still at my heart  and if a smart young colonel         with five or six thousand a year  should want one of my girls  I        shall not say nay to him  and I thought Colonel Forster looked        very becoming the other night at Sir William s in his        regimentals             Mamma   cried Lydia   my aunt says that Colonel Forster and        Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson s as they did        when they first came  she sees them now very often standing in        Clarke s library            Mrs  Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman        with a note for Miss Bennet  it came from Netherfield  and the        servant waited for an answer  Mrs  Bennet s eyes sparkled with        pleasure  and she was eagerly calling out  while her daughter        read            Well  Jane  who is it from  What is it about  What does he say         Well  Jane  make haste and tell us  make haste  my love             It is from Miss Bingley   said Jane  and then read it aloud            MY DEAR FRIEND           If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa        and me  we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest        of our lives  for a whole day s  t te   t te  between two women        can never end without a quarrel  Come as soon as you can on the        receipt of this  My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with        the officers  Yours ever            CAROLINE BINGLEY            With the officers   cried Lydia   I wonder my aunt did not tell        us of  that              Dining out   said Mrs  Bennet   that is very unlucky             Can I have the carriage   said Jane            No  my dear  you had better go on horseback  because it seems        likely to rain  and then you must stay all night             That would be a good scheme   said Elizabeth   if you were sure        that they would not offer to send her home             Oh  but the gentlemen will have Mr  Bingley s chaise to go to        Meryton  and the Hursts have no horses to theirs             I had much rather go in the coach             But  my dear  your father cannot spare the horses  I am sure         They are wanted in the farm  Mr  Bennet  are not they             They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them             But if you have got them to day   said Elizabeth   my mother s        purpose will be answered            She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the        horses were engaged  Jane was therefore obliged to go on        horseback  and her mother attended her to the door with many        cheerful prognostics of a bad day  Her hopes were answered  Jane        had not been gone long before it rained hard  Her sisters were        uneasy for her  but her mother was delighted  The rain continued        the whole evening without intermission  Jane certainly could not        come back            This was a lucky idea of mine  indeed   said Mrs  Bennet  more        than once  as if the credit of making it rain were all her own         Till the next morning  however  she was not aware of all the        felicity of her contrivance  Breakfast was scarcely over when a        servant from Netherfield brought the following note for        Elizabeth            MY DEAREST LIZZY           I find myself very unwell this morning  which  I suppose  is to        be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday  My kind friends        will not hear of my returning home till I am better  They insist also        on my seeing Mr  Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should        hear of his having been to me and  excepting a sore throat and        headache  there is not much the matter with me  Yours   c             Well  my dear   said Mr  Bennet  when Elizabeth had read the        note aloud   if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of        illness if she should die  it would be a comfort to know that it        was all in pursuit of Mr  Bingley  and under your orders             Oh  I am not at all afraid of her dying  People do not die of little        trifling colds  She will be taken good care of  As long as she        stays there  it is all very well  I would go and see her if I        could have the carriage            Elizabeth  feeling really anxious  was determined to go to her         though the carriage was not to be had  and as she was no        horsewoman  walking was her only alternative  She declared her        resolution            How can you be so silly   cried her mother   as to think of such        a thing  in all this dirt  You will not be fit to be seen when        you get there             I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want             Is this a hint to me  Lizzy   said her father   to send for the        horses             No  indeed  I do not wish to avoid the walk  The distance is        nothing  when one has a motive  only three miles  I shall be back        by dinner             I admire the activity of your benevolence   observed Mary   but        every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason  and  in my        opinion  exertion should always be in proportion to what is        required             We will go as far as Meryton with you   said Catherine and        Lydia  Elizabeth accepted their company  and the three young        ladies set off together            If we make haste   said Lydia  as they walked along   perhaps we        may see something of Captain Carter before he goes            In Meryton they parted  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings        of one of the officers  wives  and Elizabeth continued her walk        alone  crossing field after field at a quick pace  jumping over        stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity  and        finding herself at last within view of the house  with weary        ankles  dirty stockings  and a face glowing with the warmth of        exercise           She was shown into the breakfast parlour  where all but Jane were        assembled  and where her appearance created a great deal of        surprise  That she should have walked three miles so early in the        day  in such dirty weather  and by herself  was almost incredible        to Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley  and Elizabeth was convinced that        they held her in contempt for it  She was received  however  very        politely by them  and in their brother s manners there was        something better than politeness  there was good humour and        kindness  Mr  Darcy said very little  and Mr  Hurst nothing at        all  The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy        which exercise had given to her complexion  and doubt as to the        occasion s justifying her coming so far alone  The latter was        thinking only of his breakfast           Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered         Miss Bennet had slept ill  and though up  was very feverish  and        not well enough to leave her room  Elizabeth was glad to be taken        to her immediately  and Jane  who had only been withheld by the        fear of giving alarm or inconvenience  from expressing in her note        how much she longed for such a visit  was delighted at her        entrance  She was not equal  however  to much conversation  and        when Miss Bingley left them together  could attempt little        beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness        she was treated with  Elizabeth silently attended her           When breakfast was over  they were joined by the sisters  and        Elizabeth began to like them herself  when she saw how much        affection and solicitude they showed for Jane  The apothecary        came  and having examined his patient  said  as might be        supposed  that she had caught a violent cold  and that they must        endeavour to get the better of it  advised her to return to bed         and promised her some draughts  The advice was followed readily         for the feverish symptoms increased  and her head ached acutely         Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment  nor were the other        ladies often absent  the gentlemen being out  they had in fact        nothing to do elsewhere           When the clock struck three  Elizabeth felt that she must go  and        very unwillingly said so  Miss Bingley offered her the carriage         and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it  when Jane        testified such concern in parting with her  that Miss Bingley was        obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to        remain at Netherfield for the present  Elizabeth most thankfully        consented  and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint        the family with her stay  and bring back a supply of clothes           Chapter 8          At five o clock the two ladies retired to dress  and at half past        six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner  To the civil enquiries        which then poured in  and amongst which she had the pleasure of        distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr  Bingley s  she        could not make a very favourable answer  Jane was by no means        better  The sisters  on hearing this  repeated three or four        times how much they were grieved  how shocking it was to have a        bad cold  and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves         and then thought no more of the matter  and their indifference        towards Jane when not immediately before them  restored Elizabeth        to the enjoyment of all her original dislike           Their brother  indeed  was the only one of the party whom she        could regard with any complacency  His anxiety for Jane was        evident  and his attentions to herself most pleasing  and they        prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed        she was considered by the others  She had very little notice from        any but him  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr  Darcy  her sister        scarcely less so  and as for Mr  Hurst  by whom Elizabeth sat  he        was an indolent man  who lived only to eat  drink  and play at        cards  who  when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout         had nothing to say to her           When dinner was over  she returned directly to Jane  and Miss        Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room  Her        manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed  a mixture of pride        and impertinence  she had no conversation  no style  no taste  no beauty         Mrs  Hurst thought the same  and added            She has nothing  in short  to recommend her  but being an        excellent walker  I shall never forget her appearance this        morning  She really looked almost wild             She did  indeed  Louisa  I could hardly keep my countenance         Very nonsensical to come at all  Why must  she  be scampering        about the country  because her sister had a cold  Her hair so        untidy  so blowsy             Yes  and her petticoat  I hope you saw her petticoat  six inches        deep in mud  I am absolutely certain  and the gown which had been        let down to hide it not doing its office             Your picture may be very exact  Louisa   said Bingley   but this        was all lost upon me  I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked        remarkably well when she came into the room this morning  Her        dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice              You  observed it  Mr  Darcy  I am sure   said Miss Bingley          and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see  your        sister  make such an exhibition             Certainly not             To walk three miles  or four miles  or five miles  or whatever        it is  above her ankles in dirt  and alone  quite alone  what        could she mean by it  It seems to me to show an abominable sort        of conceited independence  a most country town indifference to        decorum             It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing          said Bingley            I am afraid  Mr  Darcy   observed Miss Bingley  in a half        whisper   that this adventure has rather affected your admiration        of her fine eyes             Not at all   he replied   they were brightened by the exercise          A short pause followed this speech  and Mrs  Hurst began again            I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet  she is really a        very sweet girl  and I wish with all my heart she were well        settled  But with such a father and mother  and such low        connections  I am afraid there is no chance of it             I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in        Meryton             Yes  and they have another  who lives somewhere near Cheapside             That is capital   added her sister  and they both laughed        heartily            If they had uncles enough to fill  all  Cheapside   cried        Bingley   it would not make them one jot less agreeable             But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men        of any consideration in the world   replied Darcy           To this speech Bingley made no answer  but his sisters gave it        their hearty assent  and indulged their mirth for some time at        the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations           With a renewal of tenderness  however  they repaired to her room        on leaving the dining parlour  and sat with her till summoned to        coffee  She was still very poorly  and Elizabeth would not quit        her at all  till late in the evening  when she had the comfort of        seeing her asleep  and when it appeared to her rather right than        pleasant that she should go downstairs herself  On entering the        drawing room she found the whole party at loo  and was        immediately invited to join them  but suspecting them to be        playing high she declined it  and making her sister the excuse         said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay        below  with a book  Mr  Hurst looked at her with astonishment            Do you prefer reading to cards   said he   that is rather        singular             Miss Eliza Bennet   said Miss Bingley   despises cards  She is a        great reader  and has no pleasure in anything else             I deserve neither such praise nor such censure   cried        Elizabeth   I am  not  a great reader  and I have pleasure in        many things             In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure   said        Bingley   and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her        quite well            Elizabeth thanked him from her heart  and then walked towards a        table where a few books were lying  He immediately offered to        fetch her others  all that his library afforded            And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own        credit  but I am an idle fellow  and though I have not many  I        have more than I ever looked into            Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with        those in the room            I am astonished   said Miss Bingley   that my father should have        left so small a collection of books  What a delightful library        you have at Pemberley  Mr  Darcy             It ought to be good   he replied   it has been the work of many        generations             And then you have added so much to it yourself  you are always        buying books             I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days        as these             Neglect  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the        beauties of that noble place  Charles  when you build  your         house  I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley             I wish it may             But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that        neighbourhood  and take Pemberley for a kind of model  There is        not a finer county in England than Derbyshire             With all my heart  I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will        sell it             I am talking of possibilities  Charles             Upon my word  Caroline  I should think it more possible to get        Pemberley by purchase than by imitation            Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed  as to leave her        very little attention for her book  and soon laying it wholly        aside  she drew near the card table  and stationed herself        between Mr  Bingley and his eldest sister  to observe the game            Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring   said Miss Bingley          will she be as tall as I am             I think she will  She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet s        height  or rather taller             How I long to see her again  I never met with anybody who        delighted me so much  Such a countenance  such manners  and so        extremely accomplished for her age  Her performance on the        pianoforte is exquisite             It is amazing to me   said Bingley   how young ladies can have        patience to be so very accomplished as they all are             All young ladies accomplished  My dear Charles  what do you        mean             Yes  all of them  I think  They all paint tables  cover screens         and net purses  I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this         and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first        time  without being informed that she was very accomplished             Your list of the common extent of accomplishments   said Darcy          has too much truth  The word is applied to many a woman who        deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a        screen  But I am very far from agreeing with you in your        estimation of ladies in general  I cannot boast of knowing more        than half a dozen  in the whole range of my acquaintance  that        are really accomplished             Nor I  I am sure   said Miss Bingley            Then   observed Elizabeth   you must comprehend a great deal in        your idea of an accomplished woman             Yes  I do comprehend a great deal in it             Oh  certainly   cried his faithful assistant   no one can be        really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is        usually met with  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of        music  singing  drawing  dancing  and the modern languages  to        deserve the word  and besides all this  she must possess a        certain something in her air and manner of walking  the tone of        her voice  her address and expressions  or the word will be but        half deserved             All this she must possess   added Darcy   and to all this she        must yet add something more substantial  in the improvement of        her mind by extensive reading             I am no longer surprised at your knowing  only  six accomplished        women  I rather wonder now at your knowing  any              Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility        of all this              I  never saw such a woman   I  never saw such capacity  and        taste  and application  and elegance  as you describe  united            Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice        of her implied doubt  and were both protesting that they knew        many women who answered this description  when Mr  Hurst called        them to order  with bitter complaints of their inattention to        what was going forward  As all conversation was thereby at an        end  Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room            Eliza Bennet   said Miss Bingley  when the door was closed        on her   is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend        themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own  and with        many men  I dare say  it succeeds  But  in my opinion  it is a        paltry device  a very mean art             Undoubtedly   replied Darcy  to whom this remark was chiefly        addressed   there is meanness in  all  the arts which ladies        sometimes condescend to employ for captivation  Whatever bears        affinity to cunning is despicable            Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to        continue the subject           Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was        worse  and that she could not leave her  Bingley urged Mr  Jones s        being sent for immediately  while his sisters  convinced that no        country advice could be of any service  recommended an express to        town for one of the most eminent physicians  This she would not        hear of  but she was not so unwilling to comply with their        brother s proposal  and it was settled that Mr  Jones should be        sent for early in the morning  if Miss Bennet were not decidedly        better  Bingley was quite uncomfortable  his sisters declared        that they were miserable  They solaced their wretchedness         however  by duets after supper  while he could find no better        relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions        that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her        sister           Chapter 9          Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room  and        in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable        answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr         Bingley by a housemaid  and some time afterwards from the two        elegant ladies who waited on his sisters  In spite of this        amendment  however  she requested to have a note sent to        Longbourn  desiring her mother to visit Jane  and form her own        judgment of her situation  The note was immediately dispatched         and its contents as quickly complied with  Mrs  Bennet         accompanied by her two youngest girls  reached Netherfield soon        after the family breakfast           Had she found Jane in any apparent danger  Mrs  Bennet would have        been very miserable  but being satisfied on seeing her that her        illness was not alarming  she had no wish of her recovering        immediately  as her restoration to health would probably remove        her from Netherfield  She would not listen  therefore  to her        daughter s proposal of being carried home  neither did the        apothecary  who arrived about the same time  think it at all        advisable  After sitting a little while with Jane  on Miss        Bingley s appearance and invitation  the mother and three        daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour  Bingley        met them with hopes that Mrs  Bennet had not found Miss Bennet        worse than she expected            Indeed I have  sir   was her answer   She is a great deal too        ill to be moved  Mr  Jones says we must not think of moving her         We must trespass a little longer on your kindness             Removed   cried Bingley   It must not be thought of  My sister         I am sure  will not hear of her removal             You may depend upon it  Madam   said Miss Bingley  with cold        civility   that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention        while she remains with us            Mrs  Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments            I am sure   she added   if it was not for such good friends I do        not know what would become of her  for she is very ill indeed         and suffers a vast deal  though with the greatest patience in the        world  which is always the way with her  for she has  without        exception  the sweetest temper I ever met with  I often tell        my other girls they are nothing to  her   You have a sweet room        here  Mr  Bingley  and a charming prospect over that gravel walk         I do not know a place in the country that is equal to        Netherfield  You will not think of quitting it in a hurry  I        hope  though you have but a short lease             Whatever I do is done in a hurry   replied he   and therefore if        I should resolve to quit Netherfield  I should probably be off in        five minutes  At present  however  I consider myself as quite        fixed here             That is exactly what I should have supposed of you   said        Elizabeth            You begin to comprehend me  do you   cried he  turning towards        her            Oh  yes I understand you perfectly             I wish I might take this for a compliment  but to be so easily        seen through I am afraid is pitiful             That is as it happens  It does not necessarily follow that a deep  intricate        character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours             Lizzy   cried her mother   remember where you are  and do not        run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home             I did not know before   continued Bingley immediately   that you        were a studier of character  It must be an amusing study             Yes  but intricate characters are the  most  amusing  They have        at least that advantage             The country   said Darcy   can in general supply but few        subjects for such a study  In a country neighbourhood you move in        a very confined and unvarying society             But people themselves alter so much  that there is something new        to be observed in them for ever             Yes  indeed   cried Mrs  Bennet  offended by his manner of        mentioning a country neighbourhood   I assure you there is quite        as much of  that  going on in the country as in town            Everybody was surprised  and Darcy  after looking at her for a        moment  turned silently away  Mrs  Bennet  who fancied she had        gained a complete victory over him  continued her triumph            I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the        country  for my part  except the shops and public places  The        country is a vast deal pleasanter  is not it  Mr  Bingley             When I am in the country   he replied   I never wish to leave        it  and when I am in town it is pretty much the same  They have        each their advantages  and I can be equally happy in either             Aye that is because you have the right disposition  But that        gentleman   looking at Darcy   seemed to think the country was        nothing at all             Indeed  Mama  you are mistaken   said Elizabeth  blushing for        her mother   You quite mistook Mr  Darcy  He only meant that        there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the        country as in town  which you must acknowledge to be true             Certainly  my dear  nobody said there were  but as to not        meeting with many people in this neighbourhood  I believe there        are few neighbourhoods larger  I know we dine with        four and twenty families            Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep        his countenance  His sister was less delicate  and directed her        eye towards Mr  Darcy with a very expressive smile  Elizabeth         for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s        thoughts  now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn        since  her  coming away            Yes  she called yesterday with her father  What an agreeable man        Sir William is  Mr  Bingley is not he  so much the man of        fashion  So genteel and so easy  He has always something to say to        everybody   That  is my idea of good breeding  and those persons        who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths         quite mistake the matter             Did Charlotte dine with you             No  she would go home  I fancy she was wanted about the        mince pies  For my part  Mr  Bingley   I  always keep servants        that can do their own work   my  daughters are brought up        differently  But everybody is to judge for themselves  and the        Lucases are a very good sort of girls  I assure you  It is a pity        they are not handsome  Not that  I  think Charlotte so  very         plain but then she is our particular friend             She seems a very pleasant young woman   said Bingley            Oh  dear  yes  but you must own she is very plain  Lady Lucas        herself has often said so  and envied me Jane s beauty  I do not        like to boast of my own child  but to be sure  Jane one does not        often see anybody better looking  It is what everybody says  I do        not trust my own partiality  When she was only fifteen  there was        a gentleman at my brother Gardiner s in town so much in love with her         that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before        we came away  But  however  he did not  Perhaps he thought her        too young  However  he wrote some verses on her  and very pretty        they were             And so ended his affection   said Elizabeth impatiently   There        has been many a one  I fancy  overcome in the same way  I wonder        who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away        love             I have been used to consider poetry as the  food  of love   said        Darcy            Of a fine  stout  healthy love it may  Everything nourishes what        is strong already  But if it be only a slight  thin sort of        inclination  I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it        entirely away            Darcy only smiled  and the general pause which ensued made        Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself        again  She longed to speak  but could think of nothing to say         and after a short silence Mrs  Bennet began repeating her thanks        to Mr  Bingley for his kindness to Jane  with an apology for        troubling him also with Lizzy  Mr  Bingley was unaffectedly civil        in his answer  and forced his younger sister to be civil also         and say what the occasion required  She performed her part indeed        without much graciousness  but Mrs  Bennet was satisfied  and        soon afterwards ordered her carriage  Upon this signal  the        youngest of her daughters put herself forward  The two girls had        been whispering to each other during the whole visit  and the        result of it was  that the youngest should tax Mr  Bingley with        having promised on his first coming into the country to give a        ball at Netherfield           Lydia was a stout  well grown girl of fifteen  with a fine        complexion and good humoured countenance  a favourite with her        mother  whose affection had brought her into public at an early        age  She had high animal spirits  and a sort of natural        self consequence  which the attentions of the officers  to whom        her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended        her  had increased into assurance  She was very equal  therefore         to address Mr  Bingley on the subject of the ball  and abruptly        reminded him of his promise  adding  that it would be the most        shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it  His answer to        this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear            I am perfectly ready  I assure you  to keep my engagement  and        when your sister is recovered  you shall  if you please  name the        very day of the ball  But you would not wish to be dancing while        she is ill            Lydia declared herself satisfied   Oh  yes it would be much        better to wait till Jane was well  and by that time most likely        Captain Carter would be at Meryton again  And when you have given         your  ball   she added   I shall insist on their giving one        also  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he        does not            Mrs  Bennet and her daughters then departed  and Elizabeth        returned instantly to Jane  leaving her own and her relations         behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr  Darcy  the        latter of whom  however  could not be prevailed on to join in        their censure of  her   in spite of all Miss Bingley s witticisms        on  fine eyes            Chapter 10          The day passed much as the day before had done  Mrs  Hurst and        Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the        invalid  who continued  though slowly  to mend  and in the        evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room  The        loo table  however  did not appear  Mr  Darcy was writing  and        Miss Bingley  seated near him  was watching the progress of his        letter  and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to        his sister  Mr  Hurst and Mr  Bingley were at piquet  and Mrs         Hurst was observing their game           Elizabeth took up some needlework  and was sufficiently amused in        attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion  The        perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting         or on the evenness of his lines  or on the length of his letter         with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received         formed a curious dialogue  and was exactly in unison with her        opinion of each            How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter            He made no answer            You write uncommonly fast             You are mistaken  I write rather slowly             How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course        of a year  Letters of business  too  How odious I should think        them             It is fortunate  then  that they fall to my lot instead of to        yours             Pray tell your sister that I long to see her             I have already told her so once  by your desire             I am afraid you do not like your pen  Let me mend it for you  I        mend pens remarkably well             Thank you but I always mend my own             How can you contrive to write so even            He was silent            Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on        the harp  and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with        her beautiful little design for a table  and I think it        infinitely superior to Miss Grantley s             Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write        again  At present I have not room to do them justice             Oh  it is of no consequence  I shall see her in January  But do        you always write such charming long letters to her  Mr  Darcy             They are generally long  but whether always charming  it is not        for me to determine             It is a rule with me  that a person who can write a long letter        with ease  cannot write ill             That will not do for a compliment to Darcy  Caroline   cried her        brother   because he does  not  write with ease  He studies too        much for words of four syllables  Do not you  Darcy             My style of writing is very different from yours             Oh   cried Miss Bingley   Charles writes in the most careless        way imaginable  He leaves out half his words  and blots the        rest             My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by        which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my        correspondents             Your humility  Mr  Bingley   said Elizabeth   must disarm        reproof             Nothing is more deceitful   said Darcy   than the appearance of        humility  It is often only carelessness of opinion  and sometimes        an indirect boast             And which of the two do you call  my  little recent piece of        modesty             The indirect boast  for you are really proud of your defects in        writing  because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity        of thought and carelessness of execution  which  if not        estimable  you think at least highly interesting  The power of        doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the        possessor  and often without any attention to the imperfection of        the performance  When you told Mrs  Bennet this morning that if        you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in        five minutes  you meant it to be a sort of panegyric  of        compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in        a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone         and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else             Nay   cried Bingley   this is too much  to remember at night all        the foolish things that were said in the morning  And yet  upon        my honour  I believed what I said of myself to be true  and I        believe it at this moment  At least  therefore  I did not assume        the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before        the ladies             I dare say you believed it  but I am by no means convinced that        you would be gone with such celerity  Your conduct would be quite        as dependent on chance as that of any man I know  and if  as you        were mounting your horse  a friend were to say   Bingley  you had        better stay till next week   you would probably do it  you would        probably not go and  at another word  might stay a month             You have only proved by this   cried Elizabeth   that Mr         Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition  You have shown        him off now much more than he did himself             I am exceedingly gratified   said Bingley   by your converting        what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my        temper  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that        gentleman did by no means intend  for he would certainly think        the better of me  if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat        denial  and ride off as fast as I could             Would Mr  Darcy then consider the rashness of your original        intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it             Upon my word  I cannot exactly explain the matter  Darcy must        speak for himself             You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call        mine  but which I have never acknowledged  Allowing the case         however  to stand according to your representation  you must        remember  Miss Bennet  that the friend who is supposed to desire        his return to the house  and the delay of his plan  has merely        desired it  asked it without offering one argument in favour of        its propriety             To yield readily easily to the  persuasion  of a friend is no        merit with you             To yield without conviction is no compliment to the        understanding of either             You appear to me  Mr  Darcy  to allow nothing for the influence        of friendship and affection  A regard for the requester would        often make one readily yield to a request  without waiting for        arguments to reason one into it  I am not particularly speaking        of such a case as you have supposed about Mr  Bingley  We may as        well wait  perhaps  till the circumstance occurs  before we        discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon  But in general        and ordinary cases between friend and friend  where one of them        is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great        moment  should you think ill of that person for complying with        the desire  without waiting to be argued into it             Will it not be advisable  before we proceed on this subject  to        arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which        is to appertain to this request  as well as the degree of        intimacy subsisting between the parties             By all means   cried Bingley   let us hear all the particulars         not forgetting their comparative height and size  for that will        have more weight in the argument  Miss Bennet  than you may be        aware of  I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall        fellow  in comparison with myself  I should not pay him half so        much deference  I declare I do not know a more awful object than        Darcy  on particular occasions  and in particular places  at his        own house especially  and of a Sunday evening  when he has        nothing to do            Mr  Darcy smiled  but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that        he was rather offended  and therefore checked her laugh  Miss        Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received  in an        expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense            I see your design  Bingley   said his friend   You dislike an        argument  and want to silence this             Perhaps I do  Arguments are too much like disputes  If you and        Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room  I shall        be very thankful  and then you may say whatever you like of me             What you ask   said Elizabeth   is no sacrifice on my side  and        Mr  Darcy had much better finish his letter            Mr  Darcy took her advice  and did finish his letter           When that business was over  he applied to Miss Bingley and        Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music  Miss Bingley moved        with alacrity to the pianoforte  and after a polite request        that Elizabeth would lead the way  which the other as politely and        more earnestly negatived  she seated herself           Mrs  Hurst sang with her sister  and while they were thus        employed  Elizabeth could not help observing  as she turned over        some music books that lay on the instrument  how frequently Mr         Darcy s eyes were fixed on her  She hardly knew how to suppose        that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man  and        yet that he should look at her because he disliked her  was still        more strange  She could only imagine  however  at last  that she        drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and        reprehensible  according to his ideas of right  than in any other        person present  The supposition did not pain her  She liked him        too little to care for his approbation           After playing some Italian songs  Miss Bingley varied the charm        by a lively Scotch air  and soon afterwards Mr  Darcy  drawing        near Elizabeth  said to her            Do not you feel a great inclination  Miss Bennet  to seize such        an opportunity of dancing a reel            She smiled  but made no answer  He repeated the question  with        some surprise at her silence            Oh   said she   I heard you before  but I could not immediately        determine what to say in reply  You wanted me  I know  to say         Yes   that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste         but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes  and        cheating a person of their premeditated contempt  I have         therefore  made up my mind to tell you  that I do not want to        dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare             Indeed I do not dare            Elizabeth  having rather expected to affront him  was amazed at        his gallantry  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness        in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody         and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by        her  He really believed  that were it not for the inferiority of        her connections  he should be in some danger           Miss Bingley saw  or suspected enough to be jealous  and her        great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received        some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth           She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest  by        talking of their supposed marriage  and planning his happiness in        such an alliance            I hope   said she  as they were walking together in the        shrubbery the next day   you will give your mother in law a few        hints  when this desirable event takes place  as to the advantage        of holding her tongue  and if you can compass it  do cure the        younger girls of running after the officers  And  if I may mention so        delicate a subject  endeavour to check that little something         bordering on conceit and impertinence  which your lady        possesses             Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity             Oh  yes  Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be        placed in the gallery at Pemberley  Put them next to your        great uncle the judge  They are in the same profession  you know         only in different lines  As for your Elizabeth s picture  you        must not attempt to have it taken  for what painter could do justice to        those beautiful eyes             It would not be easy  indeed  to catch their expression  but        their colour and shape  and the eyelashes  so remarkably fine         might be copied            At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs  Hurst and        Elizabeth herself            I did not know that you intended to walk   said Miss Bingley  in        some confusion  lest they had been overheard            You used us abominably ill   answered Mrs  Hurst   running away        without telling us that you were coming out            Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr  Darcy  she left Elizabeth        to walk by herself  The path just admitted three  Mr  Darcy felt        their rudeness  and immediately said             This walk is not wide enough for our party  We had better go        into the avenue            But Elizabeth  who had not the least inclination to remain with        them  laughingly answered            No  no  stay where you are  You are charmingly grouped  and        appear to uncommon advantage  The picturesque would be spoilt by        admitting a fourth  Good bye            She then ran gaily off  rejoicing as she rambled about  in the        hope of being at home again in a day or two  Jane was already so        much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of        hours that evening           Chapter 11          When the ladies removed after dinner  Elizabeth ran up to her        sister  and seeing her well guarded from cold  attended her into        the drawing room  where she was welcomed by her two friends with        many professions of pleasure  and Elizabeth had never seen them        so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the        gentlemen appeared  Their powers of conversation were        considerable  They could describe an entertainment with accuracy         relate an anecdote with humour  and laugh at their acquaintance        with spirit           But when the gentlemen entered  Jane was no longer the first        object  Miss Bingley s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy         and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many        steps  He addressed himself to Miss Bennet  with a polite        congratulation  Mr  Hurst also made her a slight bow  and said he        was  very glad   but diffuseness and warmth remained for        Bingley s salutation  He was full of joy and attention  The first        half hour was spent in piling up the fire  lest she should suffer        from the change of room  and she removed at his desire to the        other side of the fireplace  that she might be further from the        door  He then sat down by her  and talked scarcely to anyone        else  Elizabeth  at work in the opposite corner  saw it all with        great delight           When tea was over  Mr  Hurst reminded his sister in law of the        card table but in vain  She had obtained private intelligence        that Mr  Darcy did not wish for cards  and Mr  Hurst soon found        even his open petition rejected  She assured him that no one        intended to play  and the silence of the whole party on the        subject seemed to justify her  Mr  Hurst had therefore nothing to        do  but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep         Darcy took up a book  Miss Bingley did the same  and Mrs  Hurst         principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings         joined now and then in her brother s conversation with Miss        Bennet           Miss Bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching        Mr  Darcy s progress through  his  book  as in reading her own         and she was perpetually either making some enquiry  or looking at        his page  She could not win him  however  to any conversation  he        merely answered her question  and read on  At length  quite        exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book  which        she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his  she        gave a great yawn and said   How pleasant it is to spend an        evening in this way  I declare after all there is no enjoyment        like reading  How much sooner one tires of anything than of a        book  When I have a house of my own  I shall be miserable if I        have not an excellent library            No one made any reply  She then yawned again  threw aside her        book  and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some        amusement  when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss        Bennet  she turned suddenly towards him and said            By the bye  Charles  are you really serious in meditating a        dance at Netherfield  I would advise you  before you determine on        it  to consult the wishes of the present party  I am much        mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be        rather a punishment than a pleasure             If you mean Darcy   cried her brother   he may go to bed  if he        chooses  before it begins but as for the ball  it is quite a        settled thing  and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup        enough  I shall send round my cards             I should like balls infinitely better   she replied   if they        were carried on in a different manner  but there is something        insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting  It        would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of        dancing were made the order of the day             Much more rational  my dear Caroline  I dare say  but it would        not be near so much like a ball            Miss Bingley made no answer  and soon afterwards she got up and        walked about the room  Her figure was elegant  and she walked        well  but Darcy  at whom it was all aimed  was still inflexibly        studious  In the desperation of her feelings  she resolved on one        effort more  and  turning to Elizabeth  said            Miss Eliza Bennet  let me persuade you to follow my example  and        take a turn about the room  I assure you it is very refreshing        after sitting so long in one attitude            Elizabeth was surprised  but agreed to it immediately  Miss        Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility  Mr         Darcy looked up  He was as much awake to the novelty of attention        in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be  and unconsciously        closed his book  He was directly invited to join their party  but        he declined it  observing that he could imagine but two motives        for their choosing to walk up and down the room together  with        either of which motives his joining them would interfere   What        could he mean  She was dying to know what could be his        meaning   and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand        him            Not at all   was her answer   but depend upon it  he means to be        severe on us  and our surest way of disappointing him will be to        ask nothing about it            Miss Bingley  however  was incapable of disappointing Mr  Darcy        in anything  and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation        of his two motives            I have not the smallest objection to explaining them   said he         as soon as she allowed him to speak   You either choose this        method of passing the evening because you are in each other s        confidence  and have secret affairs to discuss  or because you        are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage        in walking  if the first  I would be completely in your way  and        if the second  I can admire you much better as I sit by the        fire             Oh  shocking   cried Miss Bingley   I never heard anything so        abominable  How shall we punish him for such a speech             Nothing so easy  if you have but the inclination   said        Elizabeth   We can all plague and punish one another  Tease        him laugh at him  Intimate as you are  you must know how it is to        be done             But upon my honour  I do  not   I do assure you that my intimacy        has not yet taught me  that   Tease calmness of manner and        presence of mind  No  no  I feel he may defy us there  And as to        laughter  we will not expose ourselves  if you please  by        attempting to laugh without a subject  Mr  Darcy may hug        himself             Mr  Darcy is not to be laughed at   cried Elizabeth   That is an        uncommon advantage  and uncommon I hope it will continue  for it        would be a great loss to  me  to have many such acquaintances  I        dearly love a laugh             Miss Bingley   said he   has given me more credit than can be         The wisest and the best of men nay  the wisest and best of their        actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object        in life is a joke             Certainly   replied Elizabeth  there are such people  but I hope        I am not one of  them   I hope I never ridicule what is wise and        good  Follies and nonsense  whims and inconsistencies   do         divert me  I own  and I laugh at them whenever I can  But these         I suppose  are precisely what you are without             Perhaps that is not possible for anyone  But it has been the        study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a        strong understanding to ridicule             Such as vanity and pride             Yes  vanity is a weakness indeed  But pride where there is a        real superiority of mind  pride will be always under good        regulation            Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile            Your examination of Mr  Darcy is over  I presume   said Miss        Bingley   and pray what is the result             I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr  Darcy has no defect  He        owns it himself without disguise             No   said Darcy   I have made no such pretension  I have faults        enough  but they are not  I hope  of understanding  My temper I        dare not vouch for  It is  I believe  too little        yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world  I        cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought         nor their offenses against myself  My feelings are not puffed        about with every attempt to move them  My temper would perhaps be        called resentful  My good opinion once lost  is lost forever              That  is a failing indeed   cried Elizabeth   Implacable        resentment  is  a shade in a character  But you have chosen your        fault well  I really cannot  laugh  at it  You are safe from me             There is  I believe  in every disposition a tendency to some        particular evil a natural defect  which not even the best        education can overcome             And  your  defect is to hate everybody             And yours   he replied with a smile   is willfully to        misunderstand them             Do let us have a little music   cried Miss Bingley  tired of a        conversation in which she had no share   Louisa  you will not        mind my waking Mr  Hurst            Her sister had not the smallest objection  and the pianoforte was        opened  and Darcy  after a few moments  recollection  was not        sorry for it  He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too        much attention           Chapter 12          In consequence of an agreement between the sisters  Elizabeth        wrote the next morning to their mother  to beg that the carriage        might be sent for them in the course of the day  But Mrs  Bennet         who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till        the following Tuesday  which would exactly finish Jane s week         could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before  Her        answer  therefore  was not propitious  at least not to        Elizabeth s wishes  for she was impatient to get home  Mrs         Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the        carriage before Tuesday  and in her postscript it was added  that        if Mr  Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer  she        could spare them very well  Against staying longer  however         Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it        would be asked  and fearful  on the contrary  as being considered        as intruding themselves needlessly long  she urged Jane to borrow        Mr  Bingley s carriage immediately  and at length it was settled        that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning        should be mentioned  and the request made           The communication excited many professions of concern  and enough        was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day        to work on Jane  and till the morrow their going was deferred         Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay  for        her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her        affection for the other           The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to        go so soon  and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it        would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered  but        Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right           To Mr  Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at        Netherfield long enough  She attracted him more than he liked and        Miss Bingley was uncivil to  her   and more teasing than usual to        himself  He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no        sign of admiration should  now  escape him  nothing that could        elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity  sensible        that if such an idea had been suggested  his behaviour during the        last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it         Steady to his purpose  he scarcely spoke ten words to her through        the whole of Saturday  and though they were at one time left by        themselves for half an hour  he adhered most conscientiously to        his book  and would not even look at her           On Sunday  after morning service  the separation  so agreeable to        almost all  took place  Miss Bingley s civility to Elizabeth        increased at last very rapidly  as well as her affection for        Jane  and when they parted  after assuring the latter of the        pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn        or Netherfield  and embracing her most tenderly  she even shook        hands with the former  Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in        the liveliest of spirits           They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother  Mrs         Bennet wondered at their coming  and thought them very wrong to        give so much trouble  and was sure Jane would have caught cold        again  But their father  though very laconic in his expressions        of pleasure  was really glad to see them  he had felt their        importance in the family circle  The evening conversation  when        they were all assembled  had lost much of its animation  and        almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth           They found Mary  as usual  deep in the study of thorough bass and        human nature  and had some extracts to admire  and some new        observations of threadbare morality to listen to  Catherine and        Lydia had information for them of a different sort  Much had been        done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding        Wednesday  several of the officers had dined lately with their        uncle  a private had been flogged  and it had actually been        hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married           Chapter 13           I hope  my dear   said Mr  Bennet to his wife  as they were at        breakfast the next morning   that you have ordered a good dinner        to day  because I have reason to expect an addition to our family        party             Who do you mean  my dear  I know of nobody that is coming  I am        sure  unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in and I hope         my  dinners are good enough for her  I do not believe she often        sees such at home             The person of whom I speak is a gentleman  and a stranger            Mrs  Bennet s eyes sparkled   A gentleman and a stranger  It is        Mr  Bingley  I am sure  Well  I am sure I shall be extremely glad        to see Mr  Bingley  But good Lord  how unlucky  There is not a        bit of fish to be got to day  Lydia  my love  ring the bell I        must speak to Hill this moment             It is  not  Mr  Bingley   said her husband   it is a person whom        I never saw in the whole course of my life            This roused a general astonishment  and he had the pleasure of        being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at        once           After amusing himself some time with their curiosity  he thus        explained            About a month ago I received this letter  and about a fortnight        ago I answered it  for I thought it a case of some delicacy  and        requiring early attention  It is from my cousin  Mr  Collins         who  when I am dead  may turn you all out of this house as soon        as he pleases             Oh  my dear   cried his wife   I cannot bear to hear that        mentioned  Pray do not talk of that odious man  I do think it is        the hardest thing in the world  that your estate should be        entailed away from your own children  and I am sure  if I had        been you  I should have tried long ago to do something or other        about it            Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an        entail  They had often attempted to do it before  but it was a        subject on which Mrs  Bennet was beyond the reach of reason  and        she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an        estate away from a family of five daughters  in favour of a man        whom nobody cared anything about            It certainly is a most iniquitous affair   said Mr  Bennet   and        nothing can clear Mr  Collins from the guilt of inheriting        Longbourn  But if you will listen to his letter  you may perhaps        be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself             No  that I am sure I shall not  and I think it is very        impertinent of him to write to you at all  and very hypocritical         I hate such false friends  Why could he not keep on quarreling        with you  as his father did before him             Why  indeed  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on        that head  as you will hear             Hunsford  near Westerham  Kent  15 th October             Dear Sir           The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late        honoured father always gave me much uneasiness  and since I have        had the misfortune to lose him  I have frequently wished to heal        the breach  but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts         fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to        be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him        to be at variance   There  Mrs  Bennet   My mind  however  is now        made up on the subject  for having received ordination at Easter         I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage        of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh  widow of Sir        Lewis de Bourgh  whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to        the valuable rectory of this parish  where it shall be my earnest        endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her        ladyship  and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies        which are instituted by the Church of England  As a clergyman         moreover  I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing        of peace in all families within the reach of my influence  and on        these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are        highly commendable  and that the circumstance of my being next in        the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your        side  and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch  I        cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring        your amiable daughters  and beg leave to apologise for it  as        well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible        amends but of this hereafter  If you should have no objection to        receive me into your house  I propose myself the satisfaction of        waiting on you and your family  Monday  November 18th  by four        o clock  and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the        Saturday se ennight following  which I can do without any        inconvenience  as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my        occasional absence on a Sunday  provided that some other        clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day  I remain  dear        sir  with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters  your        well wisher and friend            WILLIAM COLLINS            At four o clock  therefore  we may expect this peace making        gentleman   said Mr  Bennet  as he folded up the letter   He        seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man  upon my        word  and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance         especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him        come to us again             There is some sense in what he says about the girls  however         and if he is disposed to make them any amends  I shall not be the        person to discourage him             Though it is difficult   said Jane   to guess in what way he can        mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due  the wish is        certainly to his credit            Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for        Lady Catherine  and his kind intention of christening  marrying         and burying his parishioners whenever it were required            He must be an oddity  I think   said she   I cannot make him        out  There is something very pompous in his style  And what can        he mean by apologising for being next in the entail  We cannot        suppose he would help it if he could  Could he be a sensible man         sir             No  my dear  I think not  I have great hopes of finding him        quite the reverse  There is a mixture of servility and        self importance in his letter  which promises well  I am        impatient to see him             In point of composition   said Mary   the letter does not seem        defective  The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly        new  yet I think it is well expressed            To Catherine and Lydia  neither the letter nor its writer were in        any degree interesting  It was next to impossible that their        cousin should come in a scarlet coat  and it was now some weeks        since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any        other colour  As for their mother  Mr  Collins s letter had done        away much of her ill will  and she was preparing to see him with        a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters           Mr  Collins was punctual to his time  and was received with great        politeness by the whole family  Mr  Bennet indeed said little         but the ladies were ready enough to talk  and Mr  Collins seemed        neither in need of encouragement  nor inclined to be silent        himself  He was a tall  heavy looking young man of        five and twenty  His air was grave and stately  and his manners        were very formal  He had not been long seated before he        complimented Mrs  Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters         said he had heard much of their beauty  but that in this instance        fame had fallen short of the truth  and added  that he did not        doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage         This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers         but Mrs  Bennet  who quarreled with no compliments  answered most        readily            You are very kind  I am sure  and I wish with all my heart it        may prove so  for else they will be destitute enough  Things are        settled so oddly             You allude  perhaps  to the entail of this estate             Ah  sir  I do indeed  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls         you must confess  Not that I mean to find fault with  you   for        such things I know are all chance in this world  There is no        knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed             I am very sensible  madam  of the hardship to my fair cousins         and could say much on the subject  but that I am cautious of        appearing forward and precipitate  But I can assure the young        ladies that I come prepared to admire them  At present I will not        say more  but  perhaps  when we are better acquainted            He was interrupted by a summons to dinner  and the girls smiled        on each other  They were not the only objects of Mr  Collins s        admiration  The hall  the dining room  and all its furniture         were examined and praised  and his commendation of everything        would have touched Mrs  Bennet s heart  but for the mortifying        supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property  The        dinner too in its turn was highly admired  and he begged to know        to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was        owing  But he was set right there by Mrs  Bennet  who assured him        with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good        cook  and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen  He        begged pardon for having displeased her  In a softened tone she        declared herself not at all offended  but he continued to        apologise for about a quarter of an hour           Chapter 14          During dinner  Mr  Bennet scarcely spoke at all  but when the        servants were withdrawn  he thought it time to have some        conversation with his guest  and therefore started a subject in        which he expected him to shine  by observing that he seemed very        fortunate in his patroness  Lady Catherine de Bourgh s attention        to his wishes  and consideration for his comfort  appeared very        remarkable  Mr  Bennet could not have chosen better  Mr  Collins        was eloquent in her praise  The subject elevated him to more than        usual solemnity of manner  and with a most important aspect he        protested that  he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour        in a person of rank such affability and condescension  as he had        himself experienced from Lady Catherine  She had been graciously        pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already        had the honour of preaching before her  She had also asked him        twice to dine at Rosings  and had sent for him only the Saturday        before  to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening  Lady        Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew  but  he  had        never seen anything but affability in her  She had always spoken        to him as she would to any other gentleman  she made not the        smallest objection to his joining in the society of the        neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a        week or two  to visit his relations  She had even condescended to        advise him to marry as soon as he could  provided he chose with        discretion  and had once paid him a visit in his humble        parsonage  where she had perfectly approved all the alterations        he had been making  and had even vouchsafed to suggest some        herself some shelves in the closet up stairs             That is all very proper and civil  I am sure   said Mrs  Bennet          and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman  It is a pity that        great ladies in general are not more like her  Does she live near        you  sir             The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by        a lane from Rosings Park  her ladyship s residence             I think you said she was a widow  sir  Has she any family             She has only one daughter  the heiress of Rosings  and of very        extensive property             Ah   said Mrs  Bennet  shaking her head   then she is better off        than many girls  And what sort of young lady is she  Is she        handsome             She is a most charming young lady indeed  Lady Catherine herself        says that  in point of true beauty  Miss de Bourgh is far        superior to the handsomest of her sex  because there is that in        her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth         She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution  which has        prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments        which she could not have otherwise failed of  as I am informed by        the lady who superintended her education  and who still resides        with them  But she is perfectly amiable  and often condescends to        drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies             Has she been presented  I do not remember her name among the        ladies at court             Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in        town  and by that means  as I told Lady Catherine one day  has        deprived the British court of its brightest ornament  Her        ladyship seemed pleased with the idea  and you may imagine that I        am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate        compliments which are always acceptable to ladies  I have more        than once observed to Lady Catherine  that her charming daughter        seemed born to be a duchess  and that the most elevated rank         instead of giving her consequence  would be adorned by her  These        are the kind of little things which please her ladyship  and it        is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound        to pay             You judge very properly   said Mr  Bennet   and it is happy for        you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy  May        I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse        of the moment  or are the result of previous study             They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time  and though        I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such        little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary        occasions  I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as        possible            Mr  Bennet s expectations were fully answered  His cousin was as        absurd as he had hoped  and he listened to him with the keenest        enjoyment  maintaining at the same time the most resolute        composure of countenance  and  except in an occasional glance at        Elizabeth  requiring no partner in his pleasure           By tea time  however  the dose had been enough  and Mr  Bennet        was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again  and  when        tea was over  glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies  Mr         Collins readily assented  and a book was produced  but  on        beholding it  for everything announced it to be from a        circulating library   he started back  and begging pardon         protested that he never read novels  Kitty stared at him  and        Lydia exclaimed  Other books were produced  and after some        deliberation he chose Fordyce s Sermons  Lydia gaped as he opened        the volume  and before he had  with very monotonous solemnity         read three pages  she interrupted him with            Do you know  mamma  that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away        Richard  and if he does  Colonel Forster will hire him  My aunt        told me so herself on Saturday  I shall walk to Meryton to morrow        to hear more about it  and to ask when Mr  Denny comes back from        town            Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue  but        Mr  Collins  much offended  laid aside his book  and said            I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by        books of a serious stamp  though written solely for their        benefit  It amazes me  I confess  for  certainly  there can be        nothing so advantageous to them as instruction  But I will no        longer importune my young cousin            Then turning to Mr  Bennet  he offered himself as his antagonist        at backgammon  Mr  Bennet accepted the challenge  observing that        he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling        amusements  Mrs  Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly        for Lydia s interruption  and promised that it should not occur        again  if he would resume his book  but Mr  Collins  after        assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will  and        should never resent her behaviour as any affront  seated himself        at another table with Mr  Bennet  and prepared for backgammon           Chapter 15          Mr  Collins was not a sensible man  and the deficiency of nature        had been but little assisted by education or society  the        greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of        an illiterate and miserly father  and though he belonged to one        of the universities  he had merely kept the necessary terms         without forming at it any useful acquaintance  The subjection in        which his father had brought him up had given him originally        great humility of manner  but it was now a good deal counteracted        by the self conceit of a weak head  living in retirement  and the        consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity  A        fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh        when the living of Hunsford was vacant  and the respect which he        felt for her high rank  and his veneration for her as his        patroness  mingling with a very good opinion of himself  of his        authority as a clergyman  and his right as a rector  made him        altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness  self importance        and humility           Having now a good house and a very sufficient income  he intended        to marry  and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn        family he had a wife in view  as he meant to choose one of the        daughters  if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were        represented by common report  This was his plan of amends of        atonement for inheriting their father s estate  and he thought it        an excellent one  full of eligibility and suitableness  and        excessively generous and disinterested on his own part           His plan did not vary on seeing them  Miss Bennet s lovely face        confirmed his views  and established all his strictest notions of        what was due to seniority  and for the first evening  she  was        his settled choice  The next morning  however  made an        alteration  for in a quarter of an hour s  t te   t te  with Mrs         Bennet before breakfast  a conversation beginning with his        parsonage house  and leading naturally to the avowal of his        hopes  that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn         produced from her  amid very complaisant smiles and general        encouragement  a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on          As to her  younger  daughters  she could not take upon her to        say she could not positively answer but she did not  know  of any        prepossession  her  eldest  daughter  she must just mention she        felt it incumbent on her to hint  was likely to be very soon        engaged            Mr  Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was        soon done done while Mrs  Bennet was stirring the fire         Elizabeth  equally next to Jane in birth and beauty  succeeded        her of course           Mrs  Bennet treasured up the hint  and trusted that she might        soon have two daughters married  and the man whom she could not        bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces           Lydia s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten  every        sister except Mary agreed to go with her  and Mr  Collins was to        attend them  at the request of Mr  Bennet  who was most anxious        to get rid of him  and have his library to himself  for thither        Mr  Collins had followed him after breakfast  and there he would        continue  nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the        collection  but really talking to Mr  Bennet  with little        cessation  of his house and garden at Hunsford  Such doings        discomposed Mr  Bennet exceedingly  In his library he had been        always sure of leisure and tranquillity  and though prepared  as        he told Elizabeth  to meet with folly and conceit in every other        room of the house  he was used to be free from them there  his        civility  therefore  was most prompt in inviting Mr  Collins to        join his daughters in their walk  and Mr  Collins  being in fact        much better fitted for a walker than a reader  was extremely        pleased to close his large book  and go           In pompous nothings on his side  and civil assents on that of his        cousins  their time passed till they entered Meryton  The        attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by         him   Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in        quest of the officers  and nothing less than a very smart bonnet        indeed  or a really new muslin in a shop window  could recall        them           But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man         whom they had never seen before  of most gentlemanlike        appearance  walking with another officer on the other side of the        way  The officer was the very Mr  Denny concerning whose return        from London Lydia came to enquire  and he bowed as they passed         All were struck with the stranger s air  all wondered who he        could be  and Kitty and Lydia  determined if possible to find        out  led the way across the street  under pretense of wanting        something in an opposite shop  and fortunately had just gained        the pavement when the two gentlemen  turning back  had reached        the same spot  Mr  Denny addressed them directly  and entreated        permission to introduce his friend  Mr  Wickham  who had returned        with him the day before from town  and he was happy to say had        accepted a commission in their corps  This was exactly as it        should be  for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him        completely charming  His appearance was greatly in his favour  he        had all the best part of beauty  a fine countenance  a good        figure  and very pleasing address  The introduction was followed        up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness        at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming  and the whole        party were still standing and talking together very agreeably         when the sound of horses drew their notice  and Darcy and Bingley        were seen riding down the street  On distinguishing the ladies of        the group  the two gentlemen came directly towards them  and        began the usual civilities  Bingley was the principal spokesman         and Miss Bennet the principal object  He was then  he said  on        his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her  Mr  Darcy        corroborated it with a bow  and was beginning to determine not to        fix his eyes on Elizabeth  when they were suddenly arrested by        the sight of the stranger  and Elizabeth happening to see the        countenance of both as they looked at each other  was all        astonishment at the effect of the meeting  Both changed colour         one looked white  the other red  Mr  Wickham  after a few        moments  touched his hat a salutation which Mr  Darcy just        deigned to return  What could be the meaning of it  It was        impossible to imagine  it was impossible not to long to know           In another minute  Mr  Bingley  but without seeming to have        noticed what passed  took leave and rode on with his friend           Mr  Denny and Mr  Wickham walked with the young ladies to the        door of Mr  Phillip s house  and then made their bows  in spite        of Miss Lydia s pressing entreaties that they should come in  and        even in spite of Mrs  Phillips s throwing up the parlour window        and loudly seconding the invitation           Mrs  Phillips was always glad to see her nieces  and the two        eldest  from their recent absence  were particularly welcome  and        she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return        home  which  as their own carriage had not fetched them  she        should have known nothing about  if she had not happened to see        Mr  Jones s shop boy in the street  who had told her that they        were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the        Miss Bennets were come away  when her civility was claimed        towards Mr  Collins by Jane s introduction of him  She received        him with her very best politeness  which he returned with as much        more  apologising for his intrusion  without any previous        acquaintance with her  which he could not help flattering        himself  however  might be justified by his relationship to the        young ladies who introduced him to her notice  Mrs  Phillips was        quite awed by such an excess of good breeding  but her        contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by        exclamations and enquiries about the other  of whom  however  she        could only tell her nieces what they already knew  that Mr  Denny        had brought him from London  and that he was to have a        lieutenant s commission in the   shire  She had been watching him        the last hour  she said  as he walked up and down the street  and        had Mr  Wickham appeared  Kitty and Lydia would certainly have        continued the occupation  but unluckily no one passed windows now        except a few of the officers  who  in comparison with the        stranger  were become  stupid  disagreeable fellows   Some of        them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day  and their        aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr  Wickham  and give        him an invitation also  if the family from Longbourn would come        in the evening  This was agreed to  and Mrs  Phillips protested        that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery        tickets  and a little bit of hot supper afterwards  The prospect        of such delights was very cheering  and they parted in mutual        good spirits  Mr  Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the        room  and was assured with unwearying civility that they were        perfectly needless           As they walked home  Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen        pass between the two gentlemen  but though Jane would have        defended either or both  had they appeared to be in the wrong         she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister           Mr  Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs  Bennet by        admiring Mrs  Phillips s manners and politeness  He protested        that  except Lady Catherine and her daughter  he had never seen a        more elegant woman  for she had not only received him with the        utmost civility  but even pointedly included him in her        invitation for the next evening  although utterly unknown to her        before  Something  he supposed  might be attributed to his        connection with them  but yet he had never met with so much        attention in the whole course of his life           Chapter 16          As no objection was made to the young people s engagement with        their aunt  and all Mr  Collins s scruples of leaving Mr  and        Mrs  Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most        steadily resisted  the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at        a suitable hour to Meryton  and the girls had the pleasure of        hearing  as they entered the drawing room  that Mr  Wickham had        accepted their uncle s invitation  and was then in the house           When this information was given  and they had all taken their        seats  Mr  Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire         and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the        apartment  that he declared he might almost have supposed himself        in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings  a comparison        that did not at first convey much gratification  but when Mrs         Phillips understood from him what Rosings was  and who was its        proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one        of Lady Catherine s drawing rooms  and found that the        chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds  she felt all        the force of the compliment  and would hardly have resented a        comparison with the housekeeper s room           In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her        mansion  with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble        abode  and the improvements it was receiving  he was happily        employed until the gentlemen joined them  and he found in Mrs         Phillips a very attentive listener  whose opinion of his        consequence increased with what she heard  and who was resolving        to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could  To        the girls  who could not listen to their cousin  and who had        nothing to do but to wish for an instrument  and examine their        own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece  the        interval of waiting appeared very long  It was over at last         however  The gentlemen did approach  and when Mr  Wickham walked        into the room  Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing        him before  nor thinking of him since  with the smallest degree        of unreasonable admiration  The officers of the   shire were in        general a very creditable  gentlemanlike set  and the best of        them were of the present party  but Mr  Wickham was as far beyond        them all in person  countenance  air  and walk  as  they  were        superior to the broad faced  stuffy uncle Phillips  breathing        port wine  who followed them into the room           Mr  Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female        eye was turned  and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he        finally seated himself  and the agreeable manner in which he        immediately fell into conversation  though it was only on its        being a wet night  made her feel that the commonest  dullest         most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill        of the speaker           With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr  Wickham and        the officers  Mr  Collins seemed to sink into insignificance  to        the young ladies he certainly was nothing  but he had still at        intervals a kind listener in Mrs  Phillips  and was by her        watchfulness  most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin         When the card tables were placed  he had the opportunity of        obliging her in turn  by sitting down to whist            I know little of the game at present   said he   but I shall be        glad to improve myself  for in my situation in life   Mrs         Phillips was very glad for his compliance  but could not wait for        his reason           Mr  Wickham did not play at whist  and with ready delight was he        received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia  At first        there seemed danger of Lydia s engrossing him entirely  for she        was a most determined talker  but being likewise extremely fond        of lottery tickets  she soon grew too much interested in the        game  too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to        have attention for anyone in particular  Allowing for the common        demands of the game  Mr  Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk        to Elizabeth  and she was very willing to hear him  though what        she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the        history of his acquaintance with Mr  Darcy  She dared not even        mention that gentleman  Her curiosity  however  was unexpectedly        relieved  Mr  Wickham began the subject himself  He enquired how        far Netherfield was from Meryton  and  after receiving her        answer  asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr  Darcy had been        staying there            About a month   said Elizabeth  and then  unwilling to let the        subject drop  added   He is a man of very large property in        Derbyshire  I understand             Yes   replied Mr  Wickham   his estate there is a noble one  A        clear ten thousand per annum  You could not have met with a        person more capable of giving you certain information on that        head than myself  for I have been connected with his family in a        particular manner from my infancy            Elizabeth could not but look surprised            You may well be surprised  Miss Bennet  at such an assertion         after seeing  as you probably might  the very cold manner of our        meeting yesterday  Are you much acquainted with Mr  Darcy             As much as I ever wish to be   cried Elizabeth very warmly   I        have spent four days in the same house with him  and I think him        very disagreeable             I have no right to give  my  opinion   said Wickham   as to his        being agreeable or otherwise  I am not qualified to form one  I        have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge  It is        impossible for  me  to be impartial  But I believe your opinion        of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not        express it quite so strongly anywhere else  Here you are in your        own family             Upon my word  I say no more  here  than I might say in any house        in the neighbourhood  except Netherfield  He is not at all liked        in Hertfordshire  Everybody is disgusted with his pride  You will        not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone             I cannot pretend to be sorry   said Wickham  after a short        interruption   that he or that any man should not be estimated        beyond their deserts  but with  him  I believe it does not often        happen  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence  or        frightened by his high and imposing manners  and sees him only as        he chooses to be seen             I should take him  even on  my  slight acquaintance  to be an        ill tempered man   Wickham only shook his head            I wonder   said he  at the next opportunity of speaking          whether he is likely to be in this country much longer             I do not at all know  but I  heard  nothing of his going away        when I was at Netherfield  I hope your plans in favour of the          shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood             Oh  no it is not for  me  to be driven away by Mr  Darcy  If         he  wishes to avoid seeing  me   he must go  We are not on        friendly terms  and it always gives me pain to meet him  but I        have no reason for avoiding  him  but what I might proclaim        before all the world  a sense of very great ill usage  and most        painful regrets at his being what he is  His father  Miss Bennet         the late Mr  Darcy  was one of the best men that ever breathed         and the truest friend I ever had  and I can never be in company        with this Mr  Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a        thousand tender recollections  His behaviour to myself has been        scandalous  but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and        everything  rather than his disappointing the hopes and        disgracing the memory of his father            Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase  and        listened with all her heart  but the delicacy of it prevented        further enquiry           Mr  Wickham began to speak on more general topics  Meryton  the        neighbourhood  the society  appearing highly pleased with all        that he had yet seen  and speaking of the latter with gentle but        very intelligible gallantry            It was the prospect of constant society  and good society   he        added   which was my chief inducement to enter the   shire  I        knew it to be a most respectable  agreeable corps  and my friend        Denny tempted me further by his account of their present        quarters  and the very great attentions and excellent        acquaintances Meryton had procured them  Society  I own  is        necessary to me  I have been a disappointed man  and my spirits        will not bear solitude  I  must  have employment and society  A        military life is not what I was intended for  but circumstances        have now made it eligible  The church  ought  to have been my        profession I was brought up for the church  and I should at this        time have been in possession of a most valuable living  had it        pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now             Indeed             Yes the late Mr  Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of        the best living in his gift  He was my godfather  and excessively        attached to me  I cannot do justice to his kindness  He meant to        provide for me amply  and thought he had done it  but when the        living fell  it was given elsewhere             Good heavens   cried Elizabeth   but how could  that  be  How        could his will be disregarded  Why did you not seek legal        redress             There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest        as to give me no hope from law  A man of honour could not have        doubted the intention  but Mr  Darcy chose to doubt it or to        treat it as a merely conditional recommendation  and to assert        that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance         imprudence in short anything or nothing  Certain it is  that the        living became vacant two years ago  exactly as I was of an age to        hold it  and that it was given to another man  and no less        certain is it  that I cannot accuse myself of having really done        anything to deserve to lose it  I have a warm  unguarded temper         and I may have spoken my opinion  of  him  and  to  him  too        freely  I can recall nothing worse  But the fact is  that we are        very different sort of men  and that he hates me             This is quite shocking  He deserves to be publicly disgraced             Some time or other he  will  be but it shall not be by  me          Till I can forget his father  I can never defy or expose  him             Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings  and thought him        handsomer than ever as he expressed them            But what   said she  after a pause   can have been his motive         What can have induced him to behave so cruelly             A thorough  determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot        but attribute in some measure to jealousy  Had the late Mr  Darcy        liked me less  his son might have borne with me better  but his        father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him  I believe  very        early in life  He had not a temper to bear the sort of        competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was        often given me             I had not thought Mr  Darcy so bad as this though I have never        liked him  I had not thought so very ill of him  I had supposed        him to be despising his fellow creatures in general  but did not        suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge  such        injustice  such inhumanity as this            After a few minutes  reflection  however  she continued   I  do         remember his boasting one day  at Netherfield  of the        implacability of his resentments  of his having an unforgiving        temper  His disposition must be dreadful             I will not trust myself on the subject   replied Wickham    I         can hardly be just to him            Elizabeth was again deep in thought  and after a time exclaimed          To treat in such a manner the godson  the friend  the favourite        of his father   She could have added   A young man  too  like         you   whose very countenance may vouch for your being        amiable  but she contented herself with   and one  too  who had        probably been his companion from childhood  connected together         as I think you said  in the closest manner             We were born in the same parish  within the same park  the        greatest part of our youth was passed together  inmates of the        same house  sharing the same amusements  objects of the same        parental care   My  father began life in the profession which        your uncle  Mr  Phillips  appears to do so much credit to but he        gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr  Darcy and devoted        all his time to the care of the Pemberley property  He was most        highly esteemed by Mr  Darcy  a most intimate  confidential        friend  Mr  Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the        greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence  and        when  immediately before my father s death  Mr  Darcy gave him a        voluntary promise of providing for me  I am convinced that he        felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to  him   as of his        affection to myself             How strange   cried Elizabeth   How abominable  I wonder that        the very pride of this Mr  Darcy has not made him just to you  If        from no better motive  that he should not have been too proud to        be dishonest for dishonesty I must call it             It  is  wonderful   replied Wickham   for almost all his actions        may be traced to pride  and pride had often been his best friend         It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other        feeling  But we are none of us consistent  and in his behaviour        to me there were stronger impulses even than pride             Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good             Yes  It has often led him to be liberal and generous  to give        his money freely  to display hospitality  to assist his tenants         and relieve the poor  Family pride  and  filial  pride for he is        very proud of what his father was have done this  Not to appear        to disgrace his family  to degenerate from the popular qualities         or lose the influence of the Pemberley House  is a powerful        motive  He has also  brotherly  pride  which  with  some         brotherly affection  makes him a very kind and careful guardian        of his sister  and you will hear him generally cried up as the        most attentive and best of brothers             What sort of girl is Miss Darcy            He shook his head   I wish I could call her amiable  It gives me        pain to speak ill of a Darcy  But she is too much like her        brother very  very proud  As a child  she was affectionate and        pleasing  and extremely fond of me  and I have devoted hours and        hours to her amusement  But she is nothing to me now  She is a        handsome girl  about fifteen or sixteen  and  I understand         highly accomplished  Since her father s death  her home has been        London  where a lady lives with her  and superintends her        education            After many pauses and many trials of other subjects  Elizabeth        could not help reverting once more to the first  and saying            I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr  Bingley  How can Mr         Bingley  who seems good humour itself  and is  I really believe         truly amiable  be in friendship with such a man  How can they        suit each other  Do you know Mr  Bingley             Not at all             He is a sweet tempered  amiable  charming man  He cannot know        what Mr  Darcy is             Probably not  but Mr  Darcy can please where he chooses  He does        not want abilities  He can be a conversible companion if he        thinks it worth his while  Among those who are at all his equals        in consequence  he is a very different man from what he is to the        less prosperous  His pride never deserts him  but with the rich        he is liberal minded  just  sincere  rational  honourable  and        perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure            The whist party soon afterwards breaking up  the players gathered        round the other table and Mr  Collins took his station between        his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs  Phillips  The usual enquiries as to        his success were made by the latter  It had not been very great         he had lost every point  but when Mrs  Phillips began to express        her concern thereupon  he assured her with much earnest gravity        that it was not of the least importance  that he considered the        money as a mere trifle  and begged that she would not make        herself uneasy            I know very well  madam   said he   that when persons sit down        to a card table  they must take their chances of these things         and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five        shillings any object  There are undoubtedly many who could not        say the same  but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh  I am        removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters            Mr  Wickham s attention was caught  and after observing Mr         Collins for a few moments  he asked Elizabeth in a low voice        whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the        family of de Bourgh            Lady Catherine de Bourgh   she replied   has very lately given        him a living  I hardly know how Mr  Collins was first introduced        to her notice  but he certainly has not known her long             You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne        Darcy were sisters  consequently that she is aunt to the present        Mr  Darcy             No  indeed  I did not  I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine s        connections  I never heard of her existence till the day before        yesterday             Her daughter  Miss de Bourgh  will have a very large fortune         and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two        estates            This information made Elizabeth smile  as she thought of poor        Miss Bingley  Vain indeed must be all her attentions  vain and        useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself         if he were already self destined for another            Mr  Collins   said she   speaks highly both of Lady Catherine        and her daughter  but from some particulars that he has related        of her ladyship  I suspect his gratitude misleads him  and that        in spite of her being his patroness  she is an arrogant         conceited woman             I believe her to be both in a great degree   replied Wickham   I        have not seen her for many years  but I very well remember that I        never liked her  and that her manners were dictatorial and        insolent  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and        clever  but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities        from her rank and fortune  part from her authoritative manner         and the rest from the pride of her nephew  who chooses that        everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the        first class            Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of        it  and they continued talking together  with mutual satisfaction        till supper put an end to cards  and gave the rest of the ladies        their share of Mr  Wickham s attentions  There could be no        conversation in the noise of Mrs  Phillips s supper party  but        his manners recommended him to everybody  Whatever he said  was        said well  and whatever he did  done gracefully  Elizabeth went        away with her head full of him  She could think of nothing but of        Mr  Wickham  and of what he had told her  all the way home  but        there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went         for neither Lydia nor Mr  Collins were once silent  Lydia talked        incessantly of lottery tickets  of the fish she had lost and the        fish she had won  and Mr  Collins in describing the civility of        Mr  and Mrs  Phillips  protesting that he did not in the least        regard his losses at whist  enumerating all the dishes at supper         and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins  had more to        say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at        Longbourn House           Chapter 17          Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between        Mr  Wickham and herself  Jane listened with astonishment and        concern  she knew not how to believe that Mr  Darcy could be so        unworthy of Mr  Bingley s regard  and yet  it was not in her        nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable        appearance as Wickham  The possibility of his having endured such        unkindness  was enough to interest all her tender feelings  and        nothing remained therefore to be done  but to think well of them        both  to defend the conduct of each  and throw into the account        of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained            They have both   said she   been deceived  I dare say  in some        way or other  of which we can form no idea  Interested people        have perhaps misrepresented each to the other  It is  in short         impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which        may have alienated them  without actual blame on either side             Very true  indeed  and now  my dear Jane  what have you got to        say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been        concerned in the business  Do clear  them  too  or we shall be        obliged to think ill of somebody             Laugh as much as you choose  but you will not laugh me out of my        opinion  My dearest Lizzy  do but consider in what a disgraceful        light it places Mr  Darcy  to be treating his father s favourite        in such a manner  one whom his father had promised to provide        for  It is impossible  No man of common humanity  no man who had        any value for his character  could be capable of it  Can his most        intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him  Oh  no             I can much more easily believe Mr  Bingley s being imposed on         than that Mr  Wickham should invent such a history of himself as        he gave me last night  names  facts  everything mentioned without        ceremony  If it be not so  let Mr  Darcy contradict it  Besides         there was truth in his looks             It is difficult indeed it is distressing  One does not know what        to think             I beg your pardon  one knows exactly what to think            But Jane could think with certainty on only one point that Mr         Bingley  if he  had been  imposed on  would have much to suffer        when the affair became public           The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery  where this        conversation passed  by the arrival of the very persons of whom        they had been speaking  Mr  Bingley and his sisters came to give        their personal invitation for the long expected ball at        Netherfield  which was fixed for the following Tuesday  The two        ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again  called it        an age since they had met  and repeatedly asked what she had been        doing with herself since their separation  To the rest of the        family they paid little attention  avoiding Mrs  Bennet as much        as possible  saying not much to Elizabeth  and nothing at all to        the others  They were soon gone again  rising from their seats        with an activity which took their brother by surprise  and        hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs  Bennet s civilities           The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to        every female of the family  Mrs  Bennet chose to consider it as        given in compliment to her eldest daughter  and was particularly        flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr  Bingley himself         instead of a ceremonious card  Jane pictured to herself a happy        evening in the society of her two friends  and the attentions of        their brother  and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a        great deal with Mr  Wickham  and of seeing a confirmation of        everything in Mr  Darcy s look and behaviour  The happiness        anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single        event  or any particular person  for though they each  like        Elizabeth  meant to dance half the evening with Mr  Wickham  he        was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them  and a        ball was  at any rate  a ball  And even Mary could assure her        family that she had no disinclination for it            While I can have my mornings to myself   said she   it is        enough I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening        engagements  Society has claims on us all  and I profess myself        one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement        as desirable for everybody            Elizabeth s spirits were so high on this occasion  that though        she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr  Collins  she could        not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr  Bingley s        invitation  and if he did  whether he would think it proper to        join in the evening s amusement  and she was rather surprised to        find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head  and        was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop         or Lady Catherine de Bourgh  by venturing to dance            I am by no means of the opinion  I assure you   said he   that a        ball of this kind  given by a young man of character  to        respectable people  can have any evil tendency  and I am so far        from objecting to dancing myself  that I shall hope to be        honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of        the evening  and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours         Miss Elizabeth  for the two first dances especially  a preference        which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause         and not to any disrespect for her            Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in  She had fully        proposed being engaged by Mr  Wickham for those very dances  and        to have Mr  Collins instead  her liveliness had never been worse        timed  There was no help for it  however  Mr  Wickham s happiness        and her own were perforce delayed a little longer  and Mr         Collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could         She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea        it suggested of something more  It now first struck her  that         she  was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being        mistress of Hunsford Parsonage  and of assisting to form a        quadrille table at Rosings  in the absence of more eligible        visitors  The idea soon reached to conviction  as she observed        his increasing civilities toward herself  and heard his frequent        attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity  and though more        astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms         it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the        probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to  her          Elizabeth  however  did not choose to take the hint  being well        aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any        reply  Mr  Collins might never make the offer  and till he did         it was useless to quarrel about him           If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk        of  the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable        state at this time  for from the day of the invitation  to the        day of the ball  there was such a succession of rain as prevented        their walking to Meryton once  No aunt  no officers  no news        could be sought after the very shoe roses for Netherfield were        got by proxy  Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her        patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of        her acquaintance with Mr  Wickham  and nothing less than a dance        on Tuesday  could have made such a Friday  Saturday  Sunday  and        Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia           Chapter 18          Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield  and        looked in vain for Mr  Wickham among the cluster of red coats        there assembled  a doubt of his being present had never occurred        to her  The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any        of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed        her  She had dressed with more than usual care  and prepared in        the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained        unsubdued of his heart  trusting that it was not more than might        be won in the course of the evening  But in an instant arose the        dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr  Darcy s        pleasure in the Bingleys  invitation to the officers  and though        this was not exactly the case  the absolute fact of his absence        was pronounced by his friend Denny  to whom Lydia eagerly        applied  and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to        town on business the day before  and was not yet returned         adding  with a significant smile   I do not imagine his business        would have called him away just now  if he had not wanted to        avoid a certain gentleman here            This part of his intelligence  though unheard by Lydia  was        caught by Elizabeth  and  as it assured her that Darcy was not        less answerable for Wickham s absence than if her first surmise        had been just  every feeling of displeasure against the former        was so sharpened by immediate disappointment  that she could        hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries        which he directly afterwards approached to make  Attendance         forbearance  patience with Darcy  was injury to Wickham  She was        resolved against any sort of conversation with him  and turned        away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly        surmount even in speaking to Mr  Bingley  whose blind partiality        provoked her           But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour  and though every        prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening  it could not        dwell long on her spirits  and having told all her griefs to        Charlotte Lucas  whom she had not seen for a week  she was soon        able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her        cousin  and to point him out to her particular notice  The first        two dances  however  brought a return of distress  they were        dances of mortification  Mr  Collins  awkward and solemn         apologising instead of attending  and often moving wrong without        being aware of it  gave her all the shame and misery which a        disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give  The moment        of her release from him was ecstasy           She danced next with an officer  and had the refreshment of        talking of Wickham  and of hearing that he was universally liked         When those dances were over  she returned to Charlotte Lucas  and        was in conversation with her  when she found herself suddenly        addressed by Mr  Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his        application for her hand  that  without knowing what she did  she        accepted him  He walked away again immediately  and she was left        to fret over her own want of presence of mind  Charlotte tried to        console her            I dare say you will find him very agreeable             Heaven forbid   That  would be the greatest misfortune of all         To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate  Do not        wish me such an evil            When the dancing recommenced  however  and Darcy approached to        claim her hand  Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a        whisper  not to be a simpleton  and allow her fancy for Wickham        to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his        consequence  Elizabeth made no answer  and took her place in the        set  amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being        allowed to stand opposite to Mr  Darcy  and reading in her        neighbours  looks  their equal amazement in beholding it  They        stood for some time without speaking a word  and she began to        imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances         and at first was resolved not to break it  till suddenly fancying        that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige        him to talk  she made some slight observation on the dance  He        replied  and was again silent  After a pause of some minutes  she        addressed him a second time with   It is  your  turn to say        something now  Mr  Darcy   I  talked about the dance  and  you         ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room  or the        number of couples            He smiled  and assured her that whatever she wished him to say        should be said            Very well  That reply will do for the present  Perhaps by and by        I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public        ones  But  now  we may be silent             Do you talk by rule  then  while you are dancing             Sometimes  One must speak a little  you know  It would look odd        to be entirely silent for half an hour together  and yet for the        advantage of  some   conversation ought to be so arranged  as        that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible             Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case  or do        you imagine that you are gratifying mine             Both   replied Elizabeth archly   for I have always seen a great        similarity in the turn of our minds  We are each of an unsocial         taciturn disposition  unwilling to speak  unless we expect to say        something that will amaze the whole room  and be handed down to        posterity with all the   clat  of a proverb             This is no very striking resemblance of your own character  I am        sure   said he   How near it may be to  mine   I cannot pretend        to say   You  think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly             I must not decide on my own performance            He made no answer  and they were again silent till they had gone        down the dance  when he asked her if she and her sisters did not        very often walk to Meryton  She answered in the affirmative  and         unable to resist the temptation  added   When you met us there        the other day  we had just been forming a new acquaintance            The effect was immediate  A deeper shade of  hauteur  overspread        his features  but he said not a word  and Elizabeth  though        blaming herself for her own weakness  could not go on  At length        Darcy spoke  and in a constrained manner said   Mr  Wickham is        blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his  making         friends whether he may be equally capable of  retaining  them  is        less certain             He has been so unlucky as to lose  your  friendship   replied        Elizabeth with emphasis   and in a manner which he is likely to        suffer from all his life            Darcy made no answer  and seemed desirous of changing the        subject  At that moment  Sir William Lucas appeared close to        them  meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the        room  but on perceiving Mr  Darcy  he stopped with a bow of        superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his        partner            I have been most highly gratified indeed  my dear sir  Such very        superior dancing is not often seen  It is evident that you belong        to the first circles  Allow me to say  however  that your fair        partner does not disgrace you  and that I must hope to have this        pleasure often repeated  especially when a certain desirable        event  my dear Eliza  glancing at her sister and Bingley  shall        take place  What congratulations will then flow in  I appeal to        Mr  Darcy  but let me not interrupt you  sir  You will not thank        me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young        lady  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me            The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy  but        Sir William s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him        forcibly  and his eyes were directed with a very serious        expression towards Bingley and Jane  who were dancing together         Recovering himself  however  shortly  he turned to his partner         and said   Sir William s interruption has made me forget what we        were talking of             I do not think we were speaking at all  Sir William could not        have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for        themselves  We have tried two or three subjects already without        success  and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine             What think you of books   said he  smiling            Books oh  no  I am sure we never read the same  or not with the        same feelings             I am sorry you think so  but if that be the case  there can at        least be no want of subject  We may compare our different        opinions             No I cannot talk of books in a ball room  my head is always full        of something else             The  present  always occupies you in such scenes does it   said        he  with a look of doubt            Yes  always   she replied  without knowing what she said  for        her thoughts had wandered far from the subject  as soon        afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming   I remember        hearing you once say  Mr  Darcy  that you hardly ever forgave         that your resentment once created was unappeasable  You are very        cautious  I suppose  as to its  being created              I am   said he  with a firm voice            And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice             I hope not             It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their        opinion  to be secure of judging properly at first             May I ask to what these questions tend             Merely to the illustration of  your  character   said she         endeavouring to shake off her gravity   I am trying to make it        out             And what is your success            She shook her head   I do not get on at all  I hear such        different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly             I can readily believe   answered he gravely   that reports may        vary greatly with respect to me  and I could wish  Miss Bennet         that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment         as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no        credit on either             But if I do not take your likeness now  I may never have another        opportunity             I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours   he coldly        replied  She said no more  and they went down the other dance and        parted in silence  and on each side dissatisfied  though not to        an equal degree  for in Darcy s breast there was a tolerably        powerful feeling towards her  which soon procured her pardon  and        directed all his anger against another           They had not long separated  when Miss Bingley came towards her         and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her            So  Miss Eliza  I hear you are quite delighted with George        Wickham  Your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking        me a thousand questions  and I find that the young man quite        forgot to tell you  among his other communication  that he was        the son of old Wickham  the late Mr  Darcy s steward  Let me        recommend you  however  as a friend  not to give implicit        confidence to all his assertions  for as to Mr  Darcy s using him        ill  it is perfectly false  for  on the contrary  he has always        been remarkably kind to him  though George Wickham has treated        Mr  Darcy in a most infamous manner  I do not know the        particulars  but I know very well that Mr  Darcy is not in the        least to blame  that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham        mentioned  and that though my brother thought that he could not        well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers  he        was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the        way  His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing         indeed  and I wonder how he could presume to do it  I pity you         Miss Eliza  for this discovery of your favourite s guilt  but        really  considering his descent  one could not expect much        better             His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the        same   said Elizabeth angrily   for I have heard you accuse him        of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr  Darcy s steward         and of  that   I can assure you  he informed me himself             I beg your pardon   replied Miss Bingley  turning away with a        sneer   Excuse my interference it was kindly meant             Insolent girl   said Elizabeth to herself   You are much        mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as        this  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the        malice of Mr  Darcy   She then sought her eldest sister  who had        undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley  Jane        met her with a smile of such sweet complacency  a glow of such        happy expression  as sufficiently marked how well she was        satisfied with the occurrences of the evening  Elizabeth        instantly read her feelings  and at that moment solicitude for        Wickham  resentment against his enemies  and everything else         gave way before the hope of Jane s being in the fairest way for        happiness            I want to know   said she  with a countenance no less smiling        than her sister s   what you have learnt about Mr  Wickham  But        perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any        third person  in which case you may be sure of my pardon             No   replied Jane   I have not forgotten him  but I have nothing        satisfactory to tell you  Mr  Bingley does not know the whole of        his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which        have principally offended Mr  Darcy  but he will vouch for the        good conduct  the probity  and honour of his friend  and is        perfectly convinced that Mr  Wickham has deserved much less        attention from Mr  Darcy than he has received  and I am sorry to        say by his account as well as his sister s  Mr  Wickham is by no        means a respectable young man  I am afraid he has been very        imprudent  and has deserved to lose Mr  Darcy s regard             Mr  Bingley does not know Mr  Wickham himself             No  he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton             This account then is what he has received from Mr  Darcy  I am        satisfied  But what does he say of the living             He does not exactly recollect the circumstances  though he has        heard them from Mr  Darcy more than once  but he believes that it        was left to him  conditionally  only             I have not a doubt of Mr  Bingley s sincerity   said Elizabeth        warmly   but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances        only  Mr  Bingley s defense of his friend was a very able one  I        dare say  but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the        story  and has learnt the rest from that friend himself  I shall        venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before            She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each         and on which there could be no difference of sentiment  Elizabeth        listened with delight to the happy  though modest hopes which        Jane entertained of Mr  Bingley s regard  and said all in her        power to heighten her confidence in it  On their being joined by        Mr  Bingley himself  Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas  to whose        enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had        scarcely replied  before Mr  Collins came up to them  and told        her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as        to make a most important discovery            I have found out   said he   by a singular accident  that there        is now in the room a near relation of my patroness  I happened to        overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who        does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de        Bourgh  and of her mother Lady Catherine  How wonderfully these        sort of things occur  Who would have thought of my meeting with         perhaps  a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly  I        am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay        my respects to him  which I am now going to do  and trust he will        excuse my not having done it before  My total ignorance of the        connection must plead my apology             You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr  Darcy             Indeed I am  I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it        earlier  I believe him to be Lady Catherine s  nephew   It will        be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well        yesterday se nnight            Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  assuring        him that Mr  Darcy would consider his addressing him without        introduction as an impertinent freedom  rather than a compliment        to his aunt  that it was not in the least necessary there should        be any notice on either side  and that if it were  it must belong        to Mr  Darcy  the superior in consequence  to begin the        acquaintance  Mr  Collins listened to her with the determined air        of following his own inclination  and  when she ceased speaking         replied thus            My dear Miss Elizabeth  I have the highest opinion in the world        in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of        your understanding  but permit me to say  that there must be a        wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst        the laity  and those which regulate the clergy  for  give me        leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in        point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided        that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time        maintained  You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of        my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to perform what I        look on as a point of duty  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by        your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant        guide  though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted        by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a        young lady like yourself   And with a low bow he left her to        attack Mr  Darcy  whose reception of his advances she eagerly        watched  and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very        evident  Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and        though she could not hear a word of it  she felt as if hearing it        all  and saw in the motion of his lips the words  apology           Hunsford   and  Lady Catherine de Bourgh   It vexed her to see        him expose himself to such a man  Mr  Darcy was eyeing him with        unrestrained wonder  and when at last Mr  Collins allowed him        time to speak  replied with an air of distant civility  Mr         Collins  however  was not discouraged from speaking again  and        Mr  Darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length        of his second speech  and at the end of it he only made him a        slight bow  and moved another way  Mr  Collins then returned to        Elizabeth            I have no reason  I assure you   said he   to be dissatisfied        with my reception  Mr  Darcy seemed much pleased with the        attention  He answered me with the utmost civility  and even paid        me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady        Catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a        favour unworthily  It was really a very handsome thought  Upon        the whole  I am much pleased with him            As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue  she        turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr         Bingley  and the train of agreeable reflections which her        observations gave birth to  made her perhaps almost as happy as        Jane  She saw her in idea settled in that very house  in all the        felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow  and she        felt capable  under such circumstances  of endeavouring even to        like Bingley s two sisters  Her mother s thoughts she plainly saw        were bent the same way  and she determined not to venture near        her  lest she might hear too much  When they sat down to supper         therefore  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which        placed them within one of each other  and deeply was she vexed to        find that her mother was talking to that one person  Lady Lucas         freely  openly  and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane        would soon be married to Mr  Bingley  It was an animating        subject  and Mrs  Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while        enumerating the advantages of the match  His being such a        charming young man  and so rich  and living but three miles from        them  were the first points of self gratulation  and then it was        such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane         and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as        she could do  It was  moreover  such a promising thing for her        younger daughters  as Jane s marrying so greatly must throw them        in the way of other rich men  and lastly  it was so pleasant at        her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to        the care of their sister  that she might not be obliged to go        into company more than she liked  It was necessary to make this        circumstance a matter of pleasure  because on such occasions it        is the etiquette  but no one was less likely than Mrs  Bennet to        find comfort in staying home at any period of her life  She        concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be        equally fortunate  though evidently and triumphantly believing        there was no chance of it           In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her        mother s words  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a        less audible whisper  for  to her inexpressible vexation  she        could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr  Darcy         who sat opposite to them  Her mother only scolded her for being        nonsensical            What is Mr  Darcy to me  pray  that I should be afraid of him  I        am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged        to say nothing  he  may not like to hear             For heaven s sake  madam  speak lower  What advantage can it be        for you to offend Mr  Darcy  You will never recommend yourself to        his friend by so doing            Nothing that she could say  however  had any influence  Her        mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone         Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation  She        could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr  Darcy  though        every glance convinced her of what she dreaded  for though he was        not always looking at her mother  she was convinced that his        attention was invariably fixed by her  The expression of his face        changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and        steady gravity           At length  however  Mrs  Bennet had no more to say  and Lady        Lucas  who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights        which she saw no likelihood of sharing  was left to the comforts        of cold ham and chicken  Elizabeth now began to revive  But not        long was the interval of tranquillity  for  when supper was over         singing was talked of  and she had the mortification of seeing        Mary  after very little entreaty  preparing to oblige the        company  By many significant looks and silent entreaties  did she        endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance  but in vain         Mary would not understand them  such an opportunity of exhibiting        was delightful to her  and she began her song  Elizabeth s eyes        were fixed on her with most painful sensations  and she watched        her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which        was very ill rewarded at their close  for Mary  on receiving         amongst the thanks of the table  the hint of a hope that she        might be prevailed on to favour them again  after the pause of        half a minute began another  Mary s powers were by no means        fitted for such a display  her voice was weak  and her manner        affected  Elizabeth was in agonies  She looked at Jane  to see        how she bore it  but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley         She looked at his two sisters  and saw them making signs of        derision at each other  and at Darcy  who continued  however         imperturbably grave  She looked at her father to entreat his        interference  lest Mary should be singing all night  He took the        hint  and when Mary had finished her second song  said aloud          That will do extremely well  child  You have delighted us long        enough  Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit            Mary  though pretending not to hear  was somewhat disconcerted         and Elizabeth  sorry for her  and sorry for her father s speech         was afraid her anxiety had done no good  Others of the party were        now applied to            If I   said Mr  Collins   were so fortunate as to be able to        sing  I should have great pleasure  I am sure  in obliging the        company with an air  for I consider music as a very innocent        diversion  and perfectly compatible with the profession of a        clergyman  I do not mean  however  to assert that we can be        justified in devoting too much of our time to music  for there        are certainly other things to be attended to  The rector of a        parish has much to do  In the first place  he must make such an        agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not        offensive to his patron  He must write his own sermons  and the        time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties  and        the care and improvement of his dwelling  which he cannot be        excused from making as comfortable as possible  And I do not        think it of light importance that he should have attentive and        conciliatory manners towards everybody  especially towards those        to whom he owes his preferment  I cannot acquit him of that duty         nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of        testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the        family   And with a bow to Mr  Darcy  he concluded his speech         which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room         Many stared many smiled  but no one looked more amused than Mr         Bennet himself  while his wife seriously commended Mr  Collins        for having spoken so sensibly  and observed in a half whisper to        Lady Lucas  that he was a remarkably clever  good kind of young        man           To Elizabeth it appeared that  had her family made an agreement        to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening  it        would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more        spirit or finer success  and happy did she think it for Bingley        and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his        notice  and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much        distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed  That his        two sisters and Mr  Darcy  however  should have such an        opportunity of ridiculing her relations  was bad enough  and she        could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman         or the insolent smiles of the ladies  were more intolerable           The rest of the evening brought her little amusement  She was        teased by Mr  Collins  who continued most perseveringly by her        side  and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him        again  put it out of her power to dance with others  In vain did        she entreat him to stand up with somebody else  and offer to        introduce him to any young lady in the room  He assured her  that        as to dancing  he was perfectly indifferent to it  that his chief        object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and        that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her        the whole evening  There was no arguing upon such a project  She        owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas  who often        joined them  and good naturedly engaged Mr  Collins s        conversation to herself           She was at least free from the offense of Mr  Darcy s further        notice  though often standing within a very short distance of        her  quite disengaged  he never came near enough to speak  She        felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr         Wickham  and rejoiced in it           The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart         and  by a manoeuvre of Mrs  Bennet  had to wait for their        carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone         which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by        some of the family  Mrs  Hurst and her sister scarcely opened        their mouths  except to complain of fatigue  and were evidently        impatient to have the house to themselves  They repulsed every        attempt of Mrs  Bennet at conversation  and by so doing threw a        languor over the whole party  which was very little relieved by        the long speeches of Mr  Collins  who was complimenting Mr         Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment         and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their        behaviour to their guests  Darcy said nothing at all  Mr  Bennet         in equal silence  was enjoying the scene  Mr  Bingley and Jane        were standing together  a little detached from the rest  and        talked only to each other  Elizabeth preserved as steady a        silence as either Mrs  Hurst or Miss Bingley  and even Lydia was        too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation        of  Lord  how tired I am   accompanied by a violent yawn           When at length they arose to take leave  Mrs  Bennet was most        pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at        Longbourn  and addressed herself especially to Mr  Bingley  to        assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner        with them at any time  without the ceremony of a formal        invitation  Bingley was all grateful pleasure  and he readily        engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her         after his return from London  whither he was obliged to go the        next day for a short time           Mrs  Bennet was perfectly satisfied  and quitted the house under        the delightful persuasion that  allowing for the necessary        preparations of settlements  new carriages  and wedding clothes         she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in        the course of three or four months  Of having another daughter        married to Mr  Collins  she thought with equal certainty  and        with considerable  though not equal  pleasure  Elizabeth was the        least dear to her of all her children  and though the man and the        match were quite good enough for  her   the worth of each was        eclipsed by Mr  Bingley and Netherfield           Chapter 19          The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn  Mr  Collins made        his declaration in form  Having resolved to do it without loss of        time  as his leave of absence extended only to the following        Saturday  and having no feelings of diffidence to make it        distressing to himself even at the moment  he set about it in a        very orderly manner  with all the observances  which he supposed        a regular part of the business  On finding Mrs  Bennet         Elizabeth  and one of the younger girls together  soon after        breakfast  he addressed the mother in these words            May I hope  madam  for your interest with your fair daughter        Elizabeth  when I solicit for the honour of a private audience        with her in the course of this morning            Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise         Mrs  Bennet answered instantly   Oh dear  yes certainly  I am        sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no        objection  Come  Kitty  I want you up stairs   And  gathering her        work together  she was hastening away  when Elizabeth called out            Dear madam  do not go  I beg you will not go  Mr  Collins must        excuse me  He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not        hear  I am going away myself             No  no  nonsense  Lizzy  I desire you to stay where you are          And upon Elizabeth s seeming really  with vexed and embarrassed        looks  about to escape  she added   Lizzy  I  insist  upon your        staying and hearing Mr  Collins            Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s        consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to        get it over as soon and as quietly as possible  she sat down        again and tried to conceal  by incessant employment the feelings        which were divided between distress and diversion  Mrs  Bennet        and Kitty walked off  and as soon as they were gone  Mr  Collins        began            Believe me  my dear Miss Elizabeth  that your modesty  so far        from doing you any disservice  rather adds to your other        perfections  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had        there  not  been this little unwillingness  but allow me to        assure you  that I have your respected mother s permission for        this address  You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse         however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble  my        attentions have been too marked to be mistaken  Almost as soon as        I entered the house  I singled you out as the companion of my        future life  But before I am run away with by my feelings on this        subject  perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons        for marrying and  moreover  for coming into Hertfordshire with        the design of selecting a wife  as I certainly did            The idea of Mr  Collins  with all his solemn composure  being run        away with by his feelings  made Elizabeth so near laughing  that        she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to        stop him further  and he continued            My reasons for marrying are  first  that I think it a right        thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances  like myself  to        set the example of matrimony in his parish  secondly  that I am        convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness  and        thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier  that it        is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble        lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness  Twice has she        condescended to give me her opinion  unasked too   on this        subject  and it was but the very Saturday night before I left        Hunsford between our pools at quadrille  while Mrs  Jenkinson was        arranging Miss de Bourgh s footstool  that she said   Mr         Collins  you must marry  A clergyman like you must marry  Choose        properly  choose a gentlewoman for  my  sake  and for your  own          let her be an active  useful sort of person  not brought up high         but able to make a small income go a good way  This is my advice         Find such a woman as soon as you can  bring her to Hunsford  and        I will visit her   Allow me  by the way  to observe  my fair        cousin  that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady        Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my        power to offer  You will find her manners beyond anything I can        describe  and your wit and vivacity  I think  must be acceptable        to her  especially when tempered with the silence and respect        which her rank will inevitably excite  Thus much for my general        intention in favour of matrimony  it remains to be told why my        views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own        neighbourhood  where I can assure you there are many amiable        young women  But the fact is  that being  as I am  to inherit        this estate after the death of your honoured father  who         however  may live many years longer   I could not satisfy myself        without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters  that        the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the        melancholy event takes place which  however  as I have already        said  may not be for several years  This has been my motive  my        fair cousin  and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your        esteem  And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the        most animated language of the violence of my affection  To        fortune I am perfectly indifferent  and shall make no demand of        that nature on your father  since I am well aware that it could        not be complied with  and that one thousand pounds in the four        per cents  which will not be yours till after your mother s        decease  is all that you may ever be entitled to  On that head         therefore  I shall be uniformly silent  and you may assure        yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when        we are married            It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now            You are too hasty  sir   she cried   You forget that I have made        no answer  Let me do it without further loss of time  Accept my        thanks for the compliment you are paying me  I am very sensible        of the honour of your proposals  but it is impossible for me to        do otherwise than to decline them             I am not now to learn   replied Mr  Collins  with a formal wave        of the hand   that it is usual with young ladies to reject the        addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept  when he        first applies for their favour  and that sometimes the refusal is        repeated a second  or even a third time  I am therefore by no        means discouraged by what you have just said  and shall hope to        lead you to the altar ere long             Upon my word  sir   cried Elizabeth   your hope is a rather        extraordinary one after my declaration  I do assure you that I am        not one of those young ladies  if such young ladies there are         who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of        being asked a second time  I am perfectly serious in my refusal         You could not make  me  happy  and I am convinced that I am the        last woman in the world who could make you so  Nay  were your        friend Lady Catherine to know me  I am persuaded she would find        me in every respect ill qualified for the situation             Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so   said Mr         Collins very gravely  but I cannot imagine that her ladyship        would at all disapprove of you  And you may be certain when I        have the honour of seeing her again  I shall speak in the very        highest terms of your modesty  economy  and other amiable        qualification             Indeed  Mr  Collins  all praise of me will be unnecessary  You        must give me leave to judge for myself  and pay me the compliment        of believing what I say  I wish you very happy and very rich  and        by refusing your hand  do all in my power to prevent your being        otherwise  In making me the offer  you must have satisfied the        delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family  and may take        possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls  without any        self reproach  This matter may be considered  therefore  as        finally settled   And rising as she thus spoke  she would have        quitted the room  had Mr  Collins not thus addressed her            When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the        subject  I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than        you have now given me  though I am far from accusing you of        cruelty at present  because I know it to be the established        custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application  and        perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as        would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female        character             Really  Mr  Collins   cried Elizabeth with some warmth   you        puzzle me exceedingly  If what I have hitherto said can appear to        you in the form of encouragement  I know not how to express my        refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one             You must give me leave to flatter myself  my dear cousin  that        your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course  My        reasons for believing it are briefly these  It does not appear to        me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance  or that the        establishment I can offer would be any other than highly        desirable  My situation in life  my connections with the family        of de Bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are circumstances        highly in my favour  and you should take it into further        consideration  that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is        by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be        made you  Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all        likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable        qualifications  As I must therefore conclude that you are not        serious in your rejection of me  I shall choose to attribute it        to your wish of increasing my love by suspense  according to the        usual practice of elegant females             I do assure you  sir  that I have no pretensions whatever to        that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable        man  I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed        sincere  I thank you again and again for the honour you have done        me in your proposals  but to accept them is absolutely        impossible  My feelings in every respect forbid it  Can I speak        plainer  Do not consider me now as an elegant female  intending        to plague you  but as a rational creature  speaking the truth        from her heart             You are uniformly charming   cried he  with an air of awkward        gallantry   and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the        express authority of both your excellent parents  my proposals        will not fail of being acceptable            To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would        make no reply  and immediately and in silence withdrew         determined  if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals        as flattering encouragement  to apply to her father  whose        negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive  and        whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the        affectation and coquetry of an elegant female           Chapter 20          Mr  Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his        successful love  for Mrs  Bennet  having dawdled about in the        vestibule to watch for the end of the conference  no sooner saw        Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the        staircase  than she entered the breakfast room  and congratulated        both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their        nearer connection  Mr  Collins received and returned these        felicitations with equal pleasure  and then proceeded to relate        the particulars of their interview  with the result of which he        trusted he had every reason to be satisfied  since the refusal        which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow        from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her        character           This information  however  startled Mrs  Bennet  she would have        been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to        encourage him by protesting against his proposals  but she dared        not believe it  and could not help saying so            But  depend upon it  Mr  Collins   she added   that Lizzy shall        be brought to reason  I will speak to her about it directly  She        is a very headstrong  foolish girl  and does not know her own        interest but I will  make  her know it             Pardon me for interrupting you  madam   cried Mr  Collins   but        if she is really headstrong and foolish  I know not whether she        would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my        situation  who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage        state  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit         perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me         because if liable to such defects of temper  she could not        contribute much to my felicity             Sir  you quite misunderstand me   said Mrs  Bennet  alarmed          Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these  In everything        else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived  I will go        directly to Mr  Bennet  and we shall very soon settle it with        her  I am sure            She would not give him time to reply  but hurrying instantly to        her husband  called out as she entered the library   Oh  Mr         Bennet  you are wanted immediately  we are all in an uproar  You        must come and make Lizzy marry Mr  Collins  for she vows she will        not have him  and if you do not make haste he will change his        mind and not have  her             Mr  Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered  and        fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the        least altered by her communication            I have not the pleasure of understanding you   said he  when she        had finished her speech   Of what are you talking             Of Mr  Collins and Lizzy  Lizzy declares she will not have Mr         Collins  and Mr  Collins begins to say that he will not have        Lizzy             And what am I to do on the occasion  It seems an hopeless        business             Speak to Lizzy about it yourself  Tell her that you insist upon        her marrying him             Let her be called down  She shall hear my opinion            Mrs  Bennet rang the bell  and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the        library            Come here  child   cried her father as she appeared   I have        sent for you on an affair of importance  I understand that Mr         Collins has made you an offer of marriage  Is it true   Elizabeth        replied that it was   Very well and this offer of marriage you        have refused             I have  sir             Very well  We now come to the point  Your mother insists upon        your accepting it  Is it not so  Mrs  Bennet             Yes  or I will never see her again             An unhappy alternative is before you  Elizabeth  From this day        you must be a stranger to one of your parents  Your mother will        never see you again if you do  not  marry Mr  Collins  and I will        never see you again if you  do             Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a        beginning  but Mrs  Bennet  who had persuaded herself that her        husband regarded the affair as she wished  was excessively        disappointed            What do you mean  Mr  Bennet  in talking this way  You promised        me to  insist  upon her marrying him             My dear   replied her husband   I have two small favours to        request  First  that you will allow me the free use of my        understanding on the present occasion  and secondly  of my room         I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be            Not yet  however  in spite of her disappointment in her husband         did Mrs  Bennet give up the point  She talked to Elizabeth again        and again  coaxed and threatened her by turns  She endeavoured to        secure Jane in her interest  but Jane  with all possible        mildness  declined interfering  and Elizabeth  sometimes with        real earnestness  and sometimes with playful gaiety  replied to        her attacks  Though her manner varied  however  her determination        never did           Mr  Collins  meanwhile  was meditating in solitude on what had        passed  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what        motives his cousin could refuse him  and though his pride was        hurt  he suffered in no other way  His regard for her was quite        imaginary  and the possibility of her deserving her mother s        reproach prevented his feeling any regret           While the family were in this confusion  Charlotte Lucas came to        spend the day with them  She was met in the vestibule by Lydia         who  flying to her  cried in a half whisper   I am glad you are        come  for there is such fun here  What do you think has happened        this morning  Mr  Collins has made an offer to Lizzy  and she        will not have him            Charlotte hardly had time to answer  before they were joined by        Kitty  who came to tell the same news  and no sooner had they        entered the breakfast room  where Mrs  Bennet was alone  than she        likewise began on the subject  calling on Miss Lucas for her        compassion  and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to        comply with the wishes of all her family   Pray do  my dear Miss        Lucas   she added in a melancholy tone   for nobody is on my        side  nobody takes part with me  I am cruelly used  nobody feels        for my poor nerves            Charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and        Elizabeth            Aye  there she comes   continued Mrs  Bennet   looking as        unconcerned as may be  and caring no more for us than if we were        at York  provided she can have her own way  But I tell you  Miss        Lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer        of marriage in this way  you will never get a husband at all and        I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father        is dead   I  shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you  I        have done with you from this very day  I told you in the library         you know  that I should never speak to you again  and you will        find me as good as my word  I have no pleasure in talking to        undutiful children  Not that I have much pleasure  indeed  in        talking to anybody  People who suffer as I do from nervous        complaints can have no great inclination for talking  Nobody can        tell what I suffer  But it is always so  Those who do not        complain are never pitied            Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion  sensible that        any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase        the irritation  She talked on  therefore  without interruption        from any of them  till they were joined by Mr  Collins  who        entered the room with an air more stately than usual  and on        perceiving whom  she said to the girls   Now  I do insist upon        it  that you  all of you  hold your tongues  and let me and Mr         Collins have a little conversation together            Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room  Jane and Kitty        followed  but Lydia stood her ground  determined to hear all she        could  and Charlotte  detained first by the civility of Mr         Collins  whose enquiries after herself and all her family were        very minute  and then by a little curiosity  satisfied herself        with walking to the window and pretending not to hear  In a        doleful voice Mrs  Bennet began the projected conversation   Oh         Mr  Collins             My dear madam   replied he   let us be for ever silent on this        point  Far be it from me   he presently continued  in a voice        that marked his displeasure   to resent the behaviour of your        daughter  Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all         the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I        have been in early preferment  and I trust I am resigned  Perhaps        not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had        my fair cousin honoured me with her hand  for I have often        observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the        blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our        estimation  You will not  I hope  consider me as showing any        disrespect to your family  my dear madam  by thus withdrawing my        pretensions to your daughter s favour  without having paid        yourself and Mr  Bennet the compliment of requesting you to        interpose your authority in my behalf  My conduct may  I fear  be        objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your        daughter s lips instead of your own  But we are all liable to        error  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair  My        object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself  with        due consideration for the advantage of all your family  and if my         manner  has been at all reprehensible  I here beg leave to        apologise            Chapter 21          The discussion of Mr  Collins s offer was now nearly at an end         and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings        necessarily attending it  and occasionally from some peevish        allusions of her mother  As for the gentleman himself   his         feelings were chiefly expressed  not by embarrassment or        dejection  or by trying to avoid her  but by stiffness of manner        and resentful silence  He scarcely ever spoke to her  and the        assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself        were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas  whose        civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all         and especially to her friend           The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs  Bennet s ill humour or        ill health  Mr  Collins was also in the same state of angry        pride  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his        visit  but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it         He was always to have gone on Saturday  and to Saturday he meant        to stay           After breakfast  the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Mr         Wickham were returned  and to lament over his absence from the        Netherfield ball  He joined them on their entering the town  and        attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation  and        the concern of everybody  was well talked over  To Elizabeth         however  he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his        absence  had  been self imposed            I found   said he   as the time drew near that I had better not        meet Mr  Darcy  that to be in the same room  the same party with        him for so many hours together  might be more than I could bear         and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself            She highly approved his forbearance  and they had leisure for a        full discussion of it  and for all the commendation which they        civilly bestowed on each other  as Wickham and another officer        walked back with them to Longbourn  and during the walk he        particularly attended to her  His accompanying them was a double        advantage  she felt all the compliment it offered to herself  and        it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her        father and mother           Soon after their return  a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet         it came from Netherfield  The envelope contained a sheet of        elegant  little  hot pressed paper  well covered with a lady s        fair  flowing hand  and Elizabeth saw her sister s countenance        change as she read it  and saw her dwelling intently on some        particular passages  Jane recollected herself soon  and putting        the letter away  tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the        general conversation  but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the        subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham  and no        sooner had he and his companion taken leave  than a glance from        Jane invited her to follow her up stairs  When they had gained        their own room  Jane  taking out the letter  said            This is from Caroline Bingley  what it contains has surprised me        a good deal  The whole party have left Netherfield by this time         and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming        back again  You shall hear what she says            She then read the first sentence aloud  which comprised the        information of their having just resolved to follow their brother        to town directly  and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor        Street  where Mr  Hurst had a house  The next was in these words          I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in        Hertfordshire  except your society  my dearest friend  but we        will hope  at some future period  to enjoy many returns of that        delightful intercourse we have known  and in the meanwhile may        lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most        unreserved correspondence  I depend on you for that   To these        highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the        insensibility of distrust  and though the suddenness of their        removal surprised her  she saw nothing in it really to lament  it        was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would        prevent Mr  Bingley s being there  and as to the loss of their        society  she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it  in        the enjoyment of his            It is unlucky   said she  after a short pause   that you should        not be able to see your friends before they leave the country         But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which        Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware         and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends        will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters  Mr         Bingley will not be detained in London by them             Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into        Hertfordshire this winter  I will read it to you             When my brother left us yesterday  he imagined that the business        which took him to London might be concluded in three or four        days  but as we are certain it cannot be so  and at the same time        convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry        to leave it again  we have determined on following him thither         that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a        comfortless hotel  Many of my acquaintances are already there for        the winter  I wish that I could hear that you  my dearest friend         had any intention of making one of the crowd but of that I        despair  I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may        abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings  and        that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling        the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you             It is evident by this   added Jane   that he comes back no more        this winter             It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he         should              Why will you think so  It must be his own doing  He is his own        master  But you do not know  all   I  will  read you the passage        which particularly hurts me  I will have no reserves from  you              Mr  Darcy is impatient to see his sister  and  to confess the        truth   we  are scarcely less eager to meet her again  I really        do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty  elegance         and accomplishments  and the affection she inspires in Louisa and        myself is heightened into something still more interesting  from        the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister  I        do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on        this subject  but I will not leave the country without confiding        them  and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable  My        brother admires her greatly already  he will have frequent        opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing  her        relations all wish the connection as much as his own  and a        sister s partiality is not misleading me  I think  when I call        Charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart  With all        these circumstances to favour an attachment  and nothing to        prevent it  am I wrong  my dearest Jane  in indulging the hope of        an event which will secure the happiness of so many             What do you think of  this  sentence  my dear Lizzy   said Jane        as she finished it   Is it not clear enough  Does it not        expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to        be her sister  that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s        indifference  and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings        for him  she means  most kindly   to put me on my guard  Can        there be any other opinion on the subject             Yes  there can  for mine is totally different  Will you hear        it             Most willingly             You shall have it in a few words  Miss Bingley sees that her        brother is in love with you  and wants him to marry Miss Darcy         She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there  and tries        to persuade you that he does not care about you            Jane shook her head            Indeed  Jane  you ought to believe me  No one who has ever seen        you together can doubt his affection  Miss Bingley  I am sure         cannot  She is not such a simpleton  Could she have seen half as        much love in Mr  Darcy for herself  she would have ordered her        wedding clothes  But the case is this  We are not rich enough or        grand enough for them  and she is the more anxious to get Miss        Darcy for her brother  from the notion that when there has been         one  intermarriage  she may have less trouble in achieving a        second  in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and I dare        say it would succeed  if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way  But         my dearest Jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss        Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy  he is        in the smallest degree less sensible of  your  merit than when he        took leave of you on Tuesday  or that it will be in her power to        persuade him that  instead of being in love with you  he is very        much in love with her friend             If we thought alike of Miss Bingley   replied Jane   your        representation of all this might make me quite easy  But I know        the foundation is unjust  Caroline is incapable of wilfully        deceiving anyone  and all that I can hope in this case is that        she is deceiving herself             That is right  You could not have started a more happy idea         since you will not take comfort in mine  Believe her to be        deceived  by all means  You have now done your duty by her  and        must fret no longer             But  my dear sister  can I be happy  even supposing the best  in        accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to        marry elsewhere             You must decide for yourself   said Elizabeth   and if  upon        mature deliberation  you find that the misery of disobliging his        two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his        wife  I advise you by all means to refuse him             How can you talk so   said Jane  faintly smiling   You must know        that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their        disapprobation  I could not hesitate             I did not think you would  and that being the case  I cannot        consider your situation with much compassion             But if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be        required  A thousand things may arise in six months            The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the        utmost contempt  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of        Caroline s interested wishes  and she could not for a moment        suppose that those wishes  however openly or artfully spoken         could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone           She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she        felt on the subject  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its        happy effect  Jane s temper was not desponding  and she was        gradually led to hope  though the diffidence of affection        sometimes overcame the hope  that Bingley would return to        Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart           They agreed that Mrs  Bennet should only hear of the departure of        the family  without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s        conduct  but even this partial communication gave her a great        deal of concern  and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that        the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting        so intimate together  After lamenting it  however  at some        length  she had the consolation that Mr  Bingley would be soon        down again and soon dining at Longbourn  and the conclusion of        all was the comfortable declaration  that though he had been        invited only to a family dinner  she would take care to have two        full courses           Chapter 22          The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again        during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen        to Mr  Collins  Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her          It keeps him in good humour   said she   and I am more obliged        to you than I can express   Charlotte assured her friend of her        satisfaction in being useful  and that it amply repaid her for        the little sacrifice of her time  This was very amiable  but        Charlotte s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any        conception of  its object was nothing else than to secure her        from any return of Mr  Collins s addresses  by engaging them        towards herself  Such was Miss Lucas s scheme  and appearances        were so favourable  that when they parted at night  she would        have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave        Hertfordshire so very soon  But here she did injustice to the        fire and independence of his character  for it led him to escape        out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness         and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet  He was        anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins  from a conviction        that if they saw him depart  they could not fail to conjecture        his design  and he was not willing to have the attempt known till        its success might be known likewise  for though feeling almost        secure  and with reason  for Charlotte had been tolerably        encouraging  he was comparatively diffident since the adventure        of Wednesday  His reception  however  was of the most flattering        kind  Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked        towards the house  and instantly set out to meet him accidentally        in the lane  But little had she dared to hope that so much love        and eloquence awaited her there           In as short a time as Mr  Collins s long speeches would allow         everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both         and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name        the day that was to make him the happiest of men  and though such        a solicitation must be waived for the present  the lady felt no        inclination to trifle with his happiness  The stupidity with        which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any        charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance  and Miss        Lucas  who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested        desire of an establishment  cared not how soon that establishment        were gained           Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their        consent  and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity  Mr         Collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for        their daughter  to whom they could give little fortune  and his        prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair  Lady Lucas        began directly to calculate  with more interest than the matter        had ever excited before  how many years longer Mr  Bennet was        likely to live  and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion         that whenever Mr  Collins should be in possession of the        Longbourn estate  it would be highly expedient that both he and        his wife should make their appearance at St  James s  The whole        family  in short  were properly overjoyed on the occasion  The        younger girls formed hopes of  coming out  a year or two sooner        than they might otherwise have done  and the boys were relieved        from their apprehension of Charlotte s dying an old maid         Charlotte herself was tolerably composed  She had gained her        point  and had time to consider of it  Her reflections were in        general satisfactory  Mr  Collins  to be sure  was neither        sensible nor agreeable  his society was irksome  and his        attachment to her must be imaginary  But still he would be her        husband  Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony         marriage had always been her object  it was the only provision        for well educated young women of small fortune  and however        uncertain of giving happiness  must be their pleasantest        preservative from want  This preservative she had now obtained         and at the age of twenty seven  without having ever been        handsome  she felt all the good luck of it  The least agreeable        circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to        Elizabeth Bennet  whose friendship she valued beyond that of any        other person  Elizabeth would wonder  and probably would blame        her  and though her resolution was not to be shaken  her feelings        must be hurt by such a disapprobation  She resolved to give her        the information herself  and therefore charged Mr  Collins  when        he returned to Longbourn to dinner  to drop no hint of what had        passed before any of the family  A promise of secrecy was of        course very dutifully given  but it could not be kept without        difficulty  for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst        forth in such very direct questions on his return as required        some ingenuity to evade  and he was at the same time exercising        great self denial  for he was longing to publish his prosperous        love           As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any        of the family  the ceremony of leave taking was performed when        the ladies moved for the night  and Mrs  Bennet  with great        politeness and cordiality  said how happy they should be to see        him at Longbourn again  whenever his engagements might allow him        to visit them            My dear madam   he replied   this invitation is particularly        gratifying  because it is what I have been hoping to receive  and        you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon        as possible            They were all astonished  and Mr  Bennet  who could by no means        wish for so speedy a return  immediately said            But is there not danger of Lady Catherine s disapprobation here         my good sir  You had better neglect your relations than run the        risk of offending your patroness             My dear sir   replied Mr  Collins   I am particularly obliged to        you for this friendly caution  and you may depend upon my not        taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence             You cannot be too much upon your guard  Risk anything rather        than her displeasure  and if you find it likely to be raised by        your coming to us again  which I should think exceedingly        probable  stay quietly at home  and be satisfied that  we  shall        take no offence             Believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such        affectionate attention  and depend upon it  you will speedily        receive from me a letter of thanks for this  and for every other        mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire  As for my        fair cousins  though my absence may not be long enough to render        it necessary  I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health        and happiness  not excepting my cousin Elizabeth            With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  all of them        equally surprised that he meditated a quick return  Mrs  Bennet        wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his        addresses to one of her younger girls  and Mary might have been        prevailed on to accept him  She rated his abilities much higher        than any of the others  there was a solidity in his reflections        which often struck her  and though by no means so clever as        herself  she thought that if encouraged to read and improve        himself by such an example as hers  he might become a very        agreeable companion  But on the following morning  every hope of        this kind was done away  Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast         and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of        the day before           The possibility of Mr  Collins s fancying himself in love with        her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or        two  but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far        from possibility as she could encourage him herself  and her        astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first        the bounds of decorum  and she could not help crying out            Engaged to Mr  Collins  My dear Charlotte impossible            The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling        her story  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so        direct a reproach  though  as it was no more than she expected         she soon regained her composure  and calmly replied            Why should you be surprised  my dear Eliza  Do you think it        incredible that Mr  Collins should be able to procure any woman s        good opinion  because he was not so happy as to succeed with        you            But Elizabeth had now recollected herself  and making a strong        effort for it  was able to assure with tolerable firmness that        the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her         and that she wished her all imaginable happiness            I see what you are feeling   replied Charlotte   You must be        surprised  very much surprised so lately as Mr  Collins was        wishing to marry you  But when you have had time to think it        over  I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done  I am        not romantic  you know  I never was  I ask only a comfortable        home  and considering Mr  Collins s character  connection  and        situation in life  I am convinced that my chance of happiness        with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the        marriage state            Elizabeth quietly answered  Undoubtedly   and after an awkward        pause  they returned to the rest of the family  Charlotte did not        stay much longer  and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what        she had heard  It was a long time before she became at all        reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match  The strangeness        of Mr  Collins s making two offers of marriage within three days        was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted  She had        always felt that Charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly        like her own  but she had not supposed it to be possible that         when called into action  she would have sacrificed every better        feeling to worldly advantage  Charlotte the wife of Mr  Collins        was a most humiliating picture  And to the pang of a friend        disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem  was added the        distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to        be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen           Chapter 23          Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters  reflecting on        what she had heard  and doubting whether she was authorised to        mention it  when Sir William Lucas himself appeared  sent by his        daughter  to announce her engagement to the family  With many        compliments to them  and much self gratulation on the prospect of        a connection between the houses  he unfolded the matter to an        audience not merely wondering  but incredulous  for Mrs  Bennet         with more perseverance than politeness  protested he must be        entirely mistaken  and Lydia  always unguarded and often uncivil         boisterously exclaimed            Good Lord  Sir William  how can you tell such a story  Do not        you know that Mr  Collins wants to marry Lizzy            Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne        without anger such treatment  but Sir William s good breeding        carried him through it all  and though he begged leave to be        positive as to the truth of his information  he listened to all        their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy           Elizabeth  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so        unpleasant a situation  now put herself forward to confirm his        account  by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte        herself  and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her        mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to        Sir William  in which she was readily joined by Jane  and by        making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be        expected from the match  the excellent character of Mr  Collins         and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London           Mrs  Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal        while Sir William remained  but no sooner had he left them than        her feelings found a rapid vent  In the first place  she        persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter  secondly  she        was very sure that Mr  Collins had been taken in  thirdly  she        trusted that they would never be happy together  and fourthly         that the match might be broken off  Two inferences  however  were        plainly deduced from the whole  one  that Elizabeth was the real        cause of the mischief  and the other that she herself had been        barbarously misused by them all  and on these two points she        principally dwelt during the rest of the day  Nothing could        console and nothing could appease her  Nor did that day wear out        her resentment  A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth        without scolding her  a month passed away before she could speak        to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude  and many months        were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter           Mr  Bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion         and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most        agreeable sort  for it gratified him  he said  to discover that        Charlotte Lucas  whom he had been used to think tolerably        sensible  was as foolish as his wife  and more foolish than his        daughter           Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  but she        said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for        their happiness  nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it        as improbable  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas         for Mr  Collins was only a clergyman  and it affected them in no        other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton           Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to        retort on Mrs  Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well        married  and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to        say how happy she was  though Mrs  Bennet s sour looks and        ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness        away           Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept        them mutually silent on the subject  and Elizabeth felt persuaded        that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again         Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard        to her sister  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her        opinion could never be shaken  and for whose happiness she grew        daily more anxious  as Bingley had now been gone a week and        nothing more was heard of his return           Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter  and was        counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again         The promised letter of thanks from Mr  Collins arrived on        Tuesday  addressed to their father  and written with all the        solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family        might have prompted  After discharging his conscience on that        head  he proceeded to inform them  with many rapturous        expressions  of his happiness in having obtained the affection of        their amiable neighbour  Miss Lucas  and then explained that it        was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been        so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at        Longbourn  whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday        fortnight  for Lady Catherine  he added  so heartily approved his        marriage  that she wished it to take place as soon as possible         which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his        amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the        happiest of men           Mr  Collins s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of        pleasure to Mrs  Bennet  On the contrary  she was as much        disposed to complain of it as her husband  It was very strange        that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge  it        was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome  She hated        having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent         and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable  Such were        the gentle murmurs of Mrs  Bennet  and they gave way only to the        greater distress of Mr  Bingley s continued absence           Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject  Day        after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him        than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming        no more to Netherfield the whole winter  a report which highly        incensed Mrs  Bennet  and which she never failed to contradict as        a most scandalous falsehood           Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but        that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away         Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane s        happiness  and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover  she        could not prevent its frequently occurring  The united efforts of        his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend         assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of        London might be too much  she feared  for the strength of his        attachment           As for Jane   her  anxiety under this suspense was  of course         more painful than Elizabeth s  but whatever she felt she was        desirous of concealing  and between herself and Elizabeth         therefore  the subject was never alluded to  But as no such        delicacy restrained her mother  an hour seldom passed in which        she did not talk of Bingley  express her impatience for his        arrival  or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come        back she would think herself very ill used  It needed all Jane s        steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable        tranquillity           Mr  Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight  but his        reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been        on his first introduction  He was too happy  however  to need        much attention  and luckily for the others  the business of        love making relieved them from a great deal of his company  The        chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge  and he        sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology        for his absence before the family went to bed           Mrs  Bennet was really in a most pitiable state  The very mention        of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of        ill humour  and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it        talked of  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her  As her        successor in that house  she regarded her with jealous        abhorrence  Whenever Charlotte came to see them  she concluded        her to be anticipating the hour of possession  and whenever she        spoke in a low voice to Mr  Collins  was convinced that they were        talking of the Longbourn estate  and resolving to turn herself        and her daughters out of the house  as soon as Mr  Bennet were        dead  She complained bitterly of all this to her husband            Indeed  Mr  Bennet   said she   it is very hard to think that        Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house  that  I         should be forced to make way for  her   and live to see her take        her place in it             My dear  do not give way to such gloomy thoughts  Let us hope        for better things  Let us flatter ourselves that  I  may be the        survivor            This was not very consoling to Mrs  Bennet  and therefore         instead of making any answer  she went on as before            I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate  If        it was not for the entail  I should not mind it             What should not you mind             I should not mind anything at all             Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such        insensibility             I never can be thankful  Mr  Bennet  for anything about the        entail  How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an        estate from one s own daughters  I cannot understand  and all for        the sake of Mr  Collins too  Why should  he  have it more than        anybody else             I leave it to yourself to determine   said Mr  Bennet           Chapter 24          Miss Bingley s letter arrived  and put an end to doubt  The very        first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled        in London for the winter  and concluded with her brother s regret        at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in        Hertfordshire before he left the country           Hope was over  entirely over  and when Jane could attend to the        rest of the letter  she found little  except the professed        affection of the writer  that could give her any comfort  Miss        Darcy s praise occupied the chief of it  Her many attractions        were again dwelt on  and Caroline boasted joyfully of their        increasing intimacy  and ventured to predict the accomplishment        of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter  She        wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate        of Mr  Darcy s house  and mentioned with raptures some plans of        the latter with regard to new furniture           Elizabeth  to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all        this  heard it in silent indignation  Her heart was divided        between concern for her sister  and resentment against all        others  To Caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to        Miss Darcy she paid no credit  That he was really fond of Jane         she doubted no more than she had ever done  and much as she had        always been disposed to like him  she could not think without        anger  hardly without contempt  on that easiness of temper  that        want of proper resolution  which now made him the slave of his        designing friends  and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness        to the caprice of their inclination  Had his own happiness         however  been the only sacrifice  he might have been allowed to        sport with it in whatever manner he thought best  but her        sister s was involved in it  as she thought he must be sensible        himself  It was a subject  in short  on which reflection would be        long indulged  and must be unavailing  She could think of nothing        else  and yet whether Bingley s regard had really died away  or        were suppressed by his friends  interference  whether he had been        aware of Jane s attachment  or whether it had escaped his        observation  whatever were the case  though her opinion of him        must be materially affected by the difference  her sister s        situation remained the same  her peace equally wounded           A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her        feelings to Elizabeth  but at last  on Mrs  Bennet s leaving them        together  after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield        and its master  she could not help saying            Oh  that my dear mother had more command over herself  She can        have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual        reflections on him  But I will not repine  It cannot last long         He will be forgot  and we shall all be as we were before            Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude  but        said nothing            You doubt me   cried Jane  slightly colouring   indeed  you have        no reason  He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my        acquaintance  but that is all  I have nothing either to hope or        fear  and nothing to reproach him with  Thank God  I have not         that  pain  A little time  therefore I shall certainly try to        get the better            With a stronger voice she soon added   I have this comfort        immediately  that it has not been more than an error of fancy on        my side  and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself             My dear Jane   exclaimed Elizabeth   you are too good  Your        sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic  I do not know        what to say to you  I feel as if I had never done you justice  or        loved you as you deserve            Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit  and threw        back the praise on her sister s warm affection            Nay   said Elizabeth   this is not fair   You  wish to think all        the world respectable  and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody          I  only want to think  you  perfect  and you set yourself        against it  Do not be afraid of my running into any excess  of my        encroaching on your privilege of universal good will  You need        not  There are few people whom I really love  and still fewer of        whom I think well  The more I see of the world  the more am I        dissatisfied with it  and every day confirms my belief of the        inconsistency of all human characters  and of the little        dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or        sense  I have met with two instances lately  one I will not        mention  the other is Charlotte s marriage  It is unaccountable         In every view it is unaccountable             My dear Lizzy  do not give way to such feelings as these  They        will ruin your happiness  You do not make allowance enough for        difference of situation and temper  Consider Mr  Collins s        respectability  and Charlotte s steady  prudent character         Remember that she is one of a large family  that as to fortune         it is a most eligible match  and be ready to believe  for        everybody s sake  that she may feel something like regard and        esteem for our cousin             To oblige you  I would try to believe almost anything  but no        one else could be benefited by such a belief as this  for were I        persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him  I should only        think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart  My        dear Jane  Mr  Collins is a conceited  pompous  narrow minded         silly man  you know he is  as well as I do  and you must feel  as        well as I do  that the woman who married him cannot have a proper        way of thinking  You shall not defend her  though it is Charlotte        Lucas  You shall not  for the sake of one individual  change the        meaning of principle and integrity  nor endeavour to persuade        yourself or me  that selfishness is prudence  and insensibility        of danger security for happiness             I must think your language too strong in speaking of both          replied Jane   and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing        them happy together  But enough of this  You alluded to something        else  You mentioned  two  instances  I cannot misunderstand you         but I entreat you  dear Lizzy  not to pain me by thinking  that        person  to blame  and saying your opinion of him is sunk  We must        not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured  We must        not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and        circumspect  It is very often nothing but our own vanity that        deceives us  Women fancy admiration means more than it does             And men take care that they should             If it is designedly done  they cannot be justified  but I have        no idea of there being so much design in the world as some        persons imagine             I am far from attributing any part of Mr  Bingley s conduct to        design   said Elizabeth   but without scheming to do wrong  or to        make others unhappy  there may be error  and there may be misery         Thoughtlessness  want of attention to other people s feelings         and want of resolution  will do the business             And do you impute it to either of those             Yes  to the last  But if I go on  I shall displease you by        saying what I think of persons you esteem  Stop me whilst you        can             You persist  then  in supposing his sisters influence him             Yes  in conjunction with his friend             I cannot believe it  Why should they try to influence him  They        can only wish his happiness  and if he is attached to me  no        other woman can secure it             Your first position is false  They may wish many things besides        his happiness  they may wish his increase of wealth and        consequence  they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the        importance of money  great connections  and pride             Beyond a doubt  they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy   replied        Jane   but this may be from better feelings than you are        supposing  They have known her much longer than they have known        me  no wonder if they love her better  But  whatever may be their        own wishes  it is very unlikely they should have opposed their        brother s  What sister would think herself at liberty to do it         unless there were something very objectionable  If they believed        him attached to me  they would not try to part us  if he were so         they could not succeed  By supposing such an affection  you make        everybody acting unnaturally and wrong  and me most unhappy  Do        not distress me by the idea  I am not ashamed of having been        mistaken or  at least  it is light  it is nothing in comparison        of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters  Let        me take it in the best light  in the light in which it may be        understood            Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish  and from this time Mr         Bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them           Mrs  Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning        no more  and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did        not account for it clearly  there was little chance of her ever        considering it with less perplexity  Her daughter endeavoured to        convince her of what she did not believe herself  that his        attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and        transient liking  which ceased when he saw her no more  but        though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time         she had the same story to repeat every day  Mrs  Bennet s best        comfort was that Mr  Bingley must be down again in the summer           Mr  Bennet treated the matter differently   So  Lizzy   said he        one day   your sister is crossed in love  I find  I congratulate        her  Next to being married  a girl likes to be crossed a little        in love now and then  It is something to think of  and it gives        her a sort of distinction among her companions  When is your turn        to come  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane  Now is        your time  Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all        the young ladies in the country  Let Wickham be your man  He is a        pleasant fellow  and would jilt you creditably             Thank you  sir  but a less agreeable man would satisfy me  We        must not all expect Jane s good fortune             True   said Mr  Bennet   but it is a comfort to think that        whatever of that kind may befall you  you have an affectionate        mother who will make the most of it            Mr  Wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the        gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of        the Longbourn family  They saw him often  and to his other        recommendations was now added that of general unreserve  The        whole of what Elizabeth had already heard  his claims on Mr         Darcy  and all that he had suffered from him  was now openly        acknowledged and publicly canvassed  and everybody was pleased to        know how much they had always disliked Mr  Darcy before they had        known anything of the matter           Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might        be any extenuating circumstances in the case  unknown to the        society of Hertfordshire  her mild and steady candour always        pleaded for allowances  and urged the possibility of mistakes but        by everybody else Mr  Darcy was condemned as the worst of men           Chapter 25          After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of        felicity  Mr  Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by        the arrival of Saturday  The pain of separation  however  might        be alleviated on his side  by preparations for the reception of        his bride  as he had reason to hope  that shortly after his        return into Hertfordshire  the day would be fixed that was to        make him the happiest of men  He took leave of his relations at        Longbourn with as much solemnity as before  wished his fair        cousins health and happiness again  and promised their father        another letter of thanks           On the following Monday  Mrs  Bennet had the pleasure of        receiving her brother and his wife  who came as usual to spend        the Christmas at Longbourn  Mr  Gardiner was a sensible         gentlemanlike man  greatly superior to his sister  as well by        nature as education  The Netherfield ladies would have had        difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade  and within        view of his own warehouses  could have been so well bred and        agreeable  Mrs  Gardiner  who was several years younger than Mrs         Bennet and Mrs  Phillips  was an amiable  intelligent  elegant        woman  and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces         Between the two eldest and herself especially  there subsisted a        particular regard  They had frequently been staying with her in        town           The first part of Mrs  Gardiner s business on her arrival was to        distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions  When        this was done she had a less active part to play  It became her        turn to listen  Mrs  Bennet had many grievances to relate  and        much to complain of  They had all been very ill used since she        last saw her sister  Two of her girls had been upon the point of        marriage  and after all there was nothing in it            I do not blame Jane   she continued   for Jane would have got        Mr  Bingley if she could  But Lizzy  Oh  sister  It is very hard        to think that she might have been Mr  Collins s wife by this        time  had it not been for her own perverseness  He made her an        offer in this very room  and she refused him  The consequence of        it is  that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I        have  and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as        ever  The Lucases are very artful people indeed  sister  They are        all for what they can get  I am sorry to say it of them  but so        it is  It makes me very nervous and poorly  to be thwarted so in        my own family  and to have neighbours who think of themselves        before anybody else  However  your coming just at this time is        the greatest of comforts  and I am very glad to hear what you        tell us  of long sleeves            Mrs  Gardiner  to whom the chief of this news had been given        before  in the course of Jane and Elizabeth s correspondence with        her  made her sister a slight answer  and  in compassion to her        nieces  turned the conversation           When alone with Elizabeth afterwards  she spoke more on the        subject   It seems likely to have been a desirable match for        Jane   said she   I am sorry it went off  But these things happen        so often  A young man  such as you describe Mr  Bingley  so        easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks  and when        accident separates them  so easily forgets her  that these sort        of inconsistencies are very frequent             An excellent consolation in its way   said Elizabeth   but it        will not do for  us   We do not suffer by accident  It does not        often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a        young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom        he was violently in love with only a few days before             But that expression of  violently in love  is so hackneyed  so        doubtful  so indefinite  that it gives me very little idea  It is        as often applied to feelings which arise from a half hour s        acquaintance  as to a real  strong attachment  Pray  how  violent        was  Mr  Bingley s love             I never saw a more promising inclination  he was growing quite        inattentive to other people  and wholly engrossed by her  Every        time they met  it was more decided and remarkable  At his own        ball he offended two or three young ladies  by not asking them to        dance  and I spoke to him twice myself  without receiving an        answer  Could there be finer symptoms  Is not general incivility        the very essence of love             Oh  yes  of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt         Poor Jane  I am sorry for her  because  with her disposition  she        may not get over it immediately  It had better have happened to         you   Lizzy  you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner         But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us         Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief        from home may be as useful as anything            Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal  and felt        persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence            I hope   added Mrs  Gardiner   that no consideration with regard        to this young man will influence her  We live in so different a        part of town  all our connections are so different  and  as you        well know  we go out so little  that it is very improbable that        they should meet at all  unless he really comes to see her             And  that  is quite impossible  for he is now in the custody of        his friend  and Mr  Darcy would no more suffer him to call on        Jane in such a part of London  My dear aunt  how could you think        of it  Mr  Darcy may perhaps have  heard  of such a place as        Gracechurch Street  but he would hardly think a month s ablution        enough to cleanse him from its impurities  were he once to enter        it  and depend upon it  Mr  Bingley never stirs without him             So much the better  I hope they will not meet at all  But does        not Jane correspond with his sister   She  will not be able to        help calling             She will drop the acquaintance entirely            But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to        place this point  as well as the still more interesting one of        Bingley s being withheld from seeing Jane  she felt a solicitude        on the subject which convinced her  on examination  that she did        not consider it entirely hopeless  It was possible  and sometimes        she thought it probable  that his affection might be reanimated         and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the        more natural influence of Jane s attractions           Miss Bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure  and the        Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time  than        as she hoped by Caroline s not living in the same house with her        brother  she might occasionally spend a morning with her  without        any danger of seeing him           The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn  and what with the        Phillipses  the Lucases  and the officers  there was not a day        without its engagement  Mrs  Bennet had so carefully provided for        the entertainment of her brother and sister  that they did not        once sit down to a family dinner  When the engagement was for        home  some of the officers always made part of it of which        officers Mr  Wickham was sure to be one  and on these occasions         Mrs  Gardiner  rendered suspicious by Elizabeth s warm        commendation  narrowly observed them both  Without supposing        them  from what she saw  to be very seriously in love  their        preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little        uneasy  and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject        before she left Hertfordshire  and represent to her the        imprudence of encouraging such an attachment           To Mrs  Gardiner  Wickham had one means of affording pleasure         unconnected with his general powers  About ten or a dozen years        ago  before her marriage  she had spent a considerable time in        that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged  They had         therefore  many acquaintances in common  and though Wickham had        been little there since the death of Darcy s father  it was yet        in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former        friends than she had been in the way of procuring           Mrs  Gardiner had seen Pemberley  and known the late Mr  Darcy by        character perfectly well  Here consequently was an inexhaustible        subject of discourse  In comparing her recollection of Pemberley        with the minute description which Wickham could give  and in        bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late        possessor  she was delighting both him and herself  On being made        acquainted with the present Mr  Darcy s treatment of him  she        tried to remember some of that gentleman s reputed disposition        when quite a lad which might agree with it  and was confident at        last that she recollected having heard Mr  Fitzwilliam Darcy        formerly spoken of as a very proud  ill natured boy           Chapter 26          Mrs  Gardiner s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly        given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her        alone  after honestly telling her what she thought  she thus went        on            You are too sensible a girl  Lizzy  to fall in love merely        because you are warned against it  and  therefore  I am not        afraid of speaking openly  Seriously  I would have you be on your        guard  Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an        affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent         I have nothing to say against  him   he is a most interesting        young man  and if he had the fortune he ought to have  I should        think you could not do better  But as it is  you must not let        your fancy run away with you  You have sense  and we all expect        you to use it  Your father would depend on  your  resolution and        good conduct  I am sure  You must not disappoint your father             My dear aunt  this is being serious indeed             Yes  and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise             Well  then  you need not be under any alarm  I will take care of        myself  and of Mr  Wickham too  He shall not be in love with me         if I can prevent it             Elizabeth  you are not serious now             I beg your pardon  I will try again  At present I am not in love        with Mr  Wickham  no  I certainly am not  But he is  beyond all        comparison  the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes        really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should        not  I see the imprudence of it  Oh   that  abominable Mr  Darcy         My father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour  and I        should be miserable to forfeit it  My father  however  is partial        to Mr  Wickham  In short  my dear aunt  I should be very sorry to        be the means of making any of you unhappy  but since we see every        day that where there is affection  young people are seldom        withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into        engagements with each other  how can I promise to be wiser than        so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted  or how am I even        to know that it would be wisdom to resist  All that I can promise        you  therefore  is not to be in a hurry  I will not be in a hurry        to believe myself his first object  When I am in company with        him  I will not be wishing  In short  I will do my best             Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so        very often  At least  you should not  remind  your mother of        inviting him             As I did the other day   said Elizabeth with a conscious smile          very true  it will be wise in me to refrain from  that   But do        not imagine that he is always here so often  It is on your        account that he has been so frequently invited this week  You        know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company        for her friends  But really  and upon my honour  I will try to do        what I think to be the wisest  and now I hope you are satisfied            Her aunt assured her that she was  and Elizabeth having thanked        her for the kindness of her hints  they parted  a wonderful        instance of advice being given on such a point  without being        resented           Mr  Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been        quitted by the Gardiners and Jane  but as he took up his abode        with the Lucases  his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs         Bennet  His marriage was now fast approaching  and she was at        length so far resigned as to think it inevitable  and even        repeatedly to say  in an ill natured tone  that she   wished         they might be happy   Thursday was to be the wedding day  and on        Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit  and when she rose        to take leave  Elizabeth  ashamed of her mother s ungracious and        reluctant good wishes  and sincerely affected herself         accompanied her out of the room  As they went downstairs        together  Charlotte said            I shall depend on hearing from you very often  Eliza              That  you certainly shall             And I have another favour to ask you  Will you come and see me             We shall often meet  I hope  in Hertfordshire             I am not likely to leave Kent for some time  Promise me         therefore  to come to Hunsford            Elizabeth could not refuse  though she foresaw little pleasure in        the visit            My father and Maria are coming to me in March   added Charlotte          and I hope you will consent to be of the party  Indeed  Eliza         you will be as welcome as either of them            The wedding took place  the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent        from the church door  and everybody had as much to say  or to        hear  on the subject as usual  Elizabeth soon heard from her        friend  and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as        it had ever been  that it should be equally unreserved was        impossible  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling        that all the comfort of intimacy was over  and though determined        not to slacken as a correspondent  it was for the sake of what        had been  rather than what was  Charlotte s first letters were        received with a good deal of eagerness  there could not but be        curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home  how she        would like Lady Catherine  and how happy she would dare pronounce        herself to be  though  when the letters were read  Elizabeth felt        that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she        might have foreseen  She wrote cheerfully  seemed surrounded with        comforts  and mentioned nothing which she could not praise  The        house  furniture  neighbourhood  and roads  were all to her        taste  and Lady Catherine s behaviour was most friendly and        obliging  It was Mr  Collins s picture of Hunsford and Rosings        rationally softened  and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait        for her own visit there to know the rest           Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce        their safe arrival in London  and when she wrote again  Elizabeth        hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys           Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as        impatience generally is  Jane had been a week in town without        either seeing or hearing from Caroline  She accounted for it         however  by supposing that her last letter to her friend from        Longbourn had by some accident been lost            My aunt   she continued   is going to morrow into that part of        the town  and I shall take the opportunity of calling in        Grosvenor Street            She wrote again when the visit was paid  and she had seen Miss        Bingley   I did not think Caroline in spirits   were her words          but she was very glad to see me  and reproached me for giving        her no notice of my coming to London  I was right  therefore  my        last letter had never reached her  I enquired after their        brother  of course  He was well  but so much engaged with Mr         Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him  I found that Miss Darcy        was expected to dinner  I wish I could see her  My visit was not        long  as Caroline and Mrs  Hurst were going out  I dare say I        shall see them soon here            Elizabeth shook her head over this letter  It convinced her that        accident only could discover to Mr  Bingley her sister s being in        town           Four weeks passed away  and Jane saw nothing of him  She        endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it  but        she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley s inattention  After        waiting at home every morning for a fortnight  and inventing        every evening a fresh excuse for her  the visitor did at last        appear  but the shortness of her stay  and yet more  the        alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no        longer  The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister        will prove what she felt            My dearest Lizzy will  I am sure  be incapable of triumphing in        her better judgement  at my expense  when I confess myself to        have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley s regard for me  But         my dear sister  though the event has proved you right  do not        think me obstinate if I still assert that  considering what her        behaviour was  my confidence was as natural as your suspicion  I        do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate        with me  but if the same circumstances were to happen again  I am        sure I should be deceived again  Caroline did not return my visit        till yesterday  and not a note  not a line  did I receive in the        meantime  When she did come  it was very evident that she had no        pleasure in it  she made a slight  formal apology  for not        calling before  said not a word of wishing to see me again  and        was in every respect so altered a creature  that when she went        away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no        longer  I pity  though I cannot help blaming her  She was very        wrong in singling me out as she did  I can safely say that every        advance to intimacy began on her side  But I pity her  because        she must feel that she has been acting wrong  and because I am        very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it  I need        not explain myself farther  and though  we  know this anxiety to        be quite needless  yet if she feels it  it will easily account        for her behaviour to me  and so deservedly dear as he is to his        sister  whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural        and amiable  I cannot but wonder  however  at her having any such        fears now  because  if he had at all cared about me  we must have        met  long ago  He knows of my being in town  I am certain  from        something she said herself  and yet it would seem  by her manner        of talking  as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is        really partial to Miss Darcy  I cannot understand it  If I were        not afraid of judging harshly  I should be almost tempted to say        that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this  But I        will endeavour to banish every painful thought  and think only of        what will make me happy your affection  and the invariable        kindness of my dear uncle and aunt  Let me hear from you very        soon  Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to        Netherfield again  of giving up the house  but not with any        certainty  We had better not mention it  I am extremely glad that        you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford         Pray go to see them  with Sir William and Maria  I am sure you        will be very comfortable there  Yours  etc            This letter gave Elizabeth some pain  but her spirits returned as        she considered that Jane would no longer be duped  by the sister        at least  All expectation from the brother was now absolutely        over  She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions         His character sunk on every review of it  and as a punishment for        him  as well as a possible advantage to Jane  she seriously hoped        he might really soon marry Mr  Darcy s sister  as by Wickham s        account  she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown        away           Mrs  Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise        concerning that gentleman  and required information  and        Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to        her aunt than to herself  His apparent partiality had subsided         his attentions were over  he was the admirer of some one else         Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all  but she could see it        and write of it without material pain  Her heart had been but        slightly touched  and her vanity was satisfied with believing        that  she  would have been his only choice  had fortune permitted        it  The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most        remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering        himself agreeable  but Elizabeth  less clear sighted perhaps in        this case than in Charlotte s  did not quarrel with him for his        wish of independence  Nothing  on the contrary  could be more        natural  and while able to suppose that it cost him a few        struggles to relinquish her  she was ready to allow it a wise and        desirable measure for both  and could very sincerely wish him        happy           All this was acknowledged to Mrs  Gardiner  and after relating        the circumstances  she thus went on   I am now convinced  my dear        aunt  that I have never been much in love  for had I really        experienced that pure and elevating passion  I should at present        detest his very name  and wish him all manner of evil  But my        feelings are not only cordial towards  him   they are even        impartial towards Miss King  I cannot find out that I hate her at        all  or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good        sort of girl  There can be no love in all this  My watchfulness        has been effectual  and though I certainly should be a more        interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in        love with him  I cannot say that I regret my comparative        insignificance  Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly         Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do         They are young in the ways of the world  and not yet open to the        mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something        to live on as well as the plain            Chapter 27          With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family  and        otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton         sometimes dirty and sometimes cold  did January and February pass        away  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford  She had not at        first thought very seriously of going thither  but Charlotte  she        soon found  was depending on the plan and she gradually learned        to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater        certainty  Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte        again  and weakened her disgust of Mr  Collins  There was novelty        in the scheme  and as  with such a mother and such        uncompanionable sisters  home could not be faultless  a little        change was not unwelcome for its own sake  The journey would        moreover give her a peep at Jane  and  in short  as the time drew        near  she would have been very sorry for any delay  Everything         however  went on smoothly  and was finally settled according to        Charlotte s first sketch  She was to accompany Sir William and        his second daughter  The improvement of spending a night in        London was added in time  and the plan became perfect as plan        could be           The only pain was in leaving her father  who would certainly miss        her  and who  when it came to the point  so little liked her        going  that he told her to write to him  and almost promised to        answer her letter           The farewell between herself and Mr  Wickham was perfectly        friendly  on his side even more  His present pursuit could not        make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and        to deserve his attention  the first to listen and to pity  the        first to be admired  and in his manner of bidding her adieu         wishing her every enjoyment  reminding her of what she was to        expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh  and trusting their opinion of        her their opinion of everybody would always coincide  there was a        solicitude  an interest which she felt must ever attach her to        him with a most sincere regard  and she parted from him convinced        that  whether married or single  he must always be her model of        the amiable and pleasing           Her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her        think him less agreeable  Sir William Lucas  and his daughter        Maria  a good humoured girl  but as empty headed as himself  had        nothing to say that could be worth hearing  and were listened to        with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise  Elizabeth        loved absurdities  but she had known Sir William s too long  He        could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and        knighthood  and his civilities were worn out  like his        information           It was a journey of only twenty four miles  and they began it so        early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon  As they drove to        Mr  Gardiner s door  Jane was at a drawing room window watching        their arrival  when they entered the passage she was there to        welcome them  and Elizabeth  looking earnestly in her face  was        pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever  On the stairs        were a troop of little boys and girls  whose eagerness for their        cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the        drawing room  and whose shyness  as they had not seen her for a        twelvemonth  prevented their coming lower  All was joy and        kindness  The day passed most pleasantly away  the morning in        bustle and shopping  and the evening at one of the theatres           Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt  Their first object        was her sister  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear         in reply to her minute enquiries  that though Jane always        struggled to support her spirits  there were periods of        dejection  It was reasonable  however  to hope that they would        not continue long  Mrs  Gardiner gave her the particulars also of        Miss Bingley s visit in Gracechurch Street  and repeated        conversations occurring at different times between Jane and        herself  which proved that the former had  from her heart  given        up the acquaintance           Mrs  Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham s desertion  and        complimented her on bearing it so well            But my dear Elizabeth   she added   what sort of girl is Miss        King  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary             Pray  my dear aunt  what is the difference in matrimonial        affairs  between the mercenary and the prudent motive  Where does        discretion end  and avarice begin  Last Christmas you were afraid        of his marrying me  because it would be imprudent  and now         because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds         you want to find out that he is mercenary             If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is  I shall        know what to think             She is a very good kind of girl  I believe  I know no harm of        her             But he paid her not the smallest attention till her        grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune             No why should he  If it were not allowable for him to gain  my         affections because I had no money  what occasion could there be        for making love to a girl whom he did not care about  and who was        equally poor             But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions        towards her so soon after this event             A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those        elegant decorums which other people may observe  If  she  does        not object to it  why should  we               Her  not objecting does not justify  him   It only shows her        being deficient in something herself sense or feeling             Well   cried Elizabeth   have it as you choose   He  shall be        mercenary  and  she  shall be foolish             No  Lizzy  that is what I do  not  choose  I should be sorry         you know  to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in        Derbyshire             Oh  if that is all  I have a very poor opinion of young men who        live in Derbyshire  and their intimate friends who live in        Hertfordshire are not much better  I am sick of them all  Thank        Heaven  I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not        one agreeable quality  who has neither manner nor sense to        recommend him  Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing  after        all             Take care  Lizzy  that speech savours strongly of        disappointment            Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play  she had        the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle        and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the        summer            We have not determined how far it shall carry us   said Mrs         Gardiner   but  perhaps  to the Lakes            No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth  and her        acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful   Oh  my        dear  dear aunt   she rapturously cried   what delight  what        felicity  You give me fresh life and vigour  Adieu to        disappointment and spleen  What are young men to rocks and        mountains  Oh  what hours of transport we shall spend  And when        we  do  return  it shall not be like other travellers  without        being able to give one accurate idea of anything  We  will  know        where we have gone we  will  recollect what we have seen  Lakes         mountains  and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our        imaginations  nor when we attempt to describe any particular        scene  will we begin quarreling about its relative situation  Let         our  first effusions be less insupportable than those of the        generality of travellers            Chapter 28          Every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to        Elizabeth  and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment  for she        had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her        health  and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant        source of delight           When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford  every eye        was in search of the Parsonage  and every turning expected to        bring it in view  The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary        on one side  Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she        had heard of its inhabitants           At length the Parsonage was discernible  The garden sloping to        the road  the house standing in it  the green pales  and the        laurel hedge  everything declared they were arriving  Mr  Collins        and Charlotte appeared at the door  and the carriage stopped at        the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house         amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party  In a moment they        were all out of the chaise  rejoicing at the sight of each other         Mrs  Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure  and        Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found        herself so affectionately received  She saw instantly that her        cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage  his formal        civility was just what it had been  and he detained her some        minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all        her family  They were then  with no other delay than his pointing        out the neatness of the entrance  taken into the house  and as        soon as they were in the parlour  he welcomed them a second time         with ostentatious formality to his humble abode  and punctually        repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment           Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory  and she could not        help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the        room  its aspect and its furniture  he addressed himself        particularly to her  as if wishing to make her feel what she had        lost in refusing him  But though everything seemed neat and        comfortable  she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of        repentance  and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she        could have so cheerful an air with such a companion  When Mr         Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be        ashamed  which certainly was not unseldom  she involuntarily        turned her eye on Charlotte  Once or twice she could discern a        faint blush  but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear  After        sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the        room  from the sideboard to the fender  to give an account of        their journey  and of all that had happened in London  Mr         Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden  which was        large and well laid out  and to the cultivation of which he        attended himself  To work in this garden was one of his most        respectable pleasures  and Elizabeth admired the command of        countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of        the exercise  and owned she encouraged it as much as possible         Here  leading the way through every walk and cross walk  and        scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked        for  every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left        beauty entirely behind  He could number the fields in every        direction  and could tell how many trees there were in the most        distant clump  But of all the views which his garden  or which        the country or kingdom could boast  none were to be compared with        the prospect of Rosings  afforded by an opening in the trees that        bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house  It was        a handsome modern building  well situated on rising ground           From his garden  Mr  Collins would have led them round his two        meadows  but the ladies  not having shoes to encounter the        remains of a white frost  turned back  and while Sir William        accompanied him  Charlotte took her sister and friend over the        house  extremely well pleased  probably  to have the opportunity        of showing it without her husband s help  It was rather small         but well built and convenient  and everything was fitted up and        arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave        Charlotte all the credit  When Mr  Collins could be forgotten         there was really an air of great comfort throughout  and by        Charlotte s evident enjoyment of it  Elizabeth supposed he must        be often forgotten           She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the        country  It was spoken of again while they were at dinner  when        Mr  Collins joining in  observed            Yes  Miss Elizabeth  you will have the honour of seeing Lady        Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church  and I need        not say you will be delighted with her  She is all affability and        condescension  and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some        portion of her notice when service is over  I have scarcely any        hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in        every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here         Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming  We dine at        Rosings twice every week  and are never allowed to walk home  Her        ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us  I  should  say         one of her ladyship s carriages  for she has several             Lady Catherine is a very respectable  sensible woman indeed          added Charlotte   and a most attentive neighbour             Very true  my dear  that is exactly what I say  She is the sort        of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference            The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news         and telling again what had already been written  and when it        closed  Elizabeth  in the solitude of her chamber  had to        meditate upon Charlotte s degree of contentment  to understand        her address in guiding  and composure in bearing with  her        husband  and to acknowledge that it was all done very well  She        had also to anticipate how her visit would pass  the quiet tenor        of their usual employments  the vexatious interruptions of Mr         Collins  and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings  A        lively imagination soon settled it all           About the middle of the next day  as she was in her room getting        ready for a walk  a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole        house in confusion  and  after listening a moment  she heard        somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry  and calling loudly        after her  She opened the door and met Maria in the landing        place  who  breathless with agitation  cried out            Oh  my dear Eliza  pray make haste and come into the        dining room  for there is such a sight to be seen  I will not        tell you what it is  Make haste  and come down this moment            Elizabeth asked questions in vain  Maria would tell her nothing        more  and down they ran into the dining room  which fronted the        lane  in quest of this wonder  It was two ladies stopping in a        low phaeton at the garden gate            And is this all   cried Elizabeth   I expected at least that the        pigs were got into the garden  and here is nothing but Lady        Catherine and her daughter             La  my dear   said Maria  quite shocked at the mistake   it is        not Lady Catherine  The old lady is Mrs  Jenkinson  who lives        with them  the other is Miss de Bourgh  Only look at her  She is        quite a little creature  Who would have thought that she could be        so thin and small             She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all        this wind  Why does she not come in             Oh  Charlotte says she hardly ever does  It is the greatest of        favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in             I like her appearance   said Elizabeth  struck with other ideas          She looks sickly and cross  Yes  she will do for him very well         She will make him a very proper wife            Mr  Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in        conversation with the ladies  and Sir William  to Elizabeth s        high diversion  was stationed in the doorway  in earnest        contemplation of the greatness before him  and constantly bowing        whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way           At length there was nothing more to be said  the ladies drove on         and the others returned into the house  Mr  Collins no sooner saw        the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good        fortune  which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the        whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day           Chapter 29          Mr  Collins s triumph  in consequence of this invitation  was        complete  The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness        to his wondering visitors  and of letting them see her civility        towards himself and his wife  was exactly what he had wished for         and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon  was        such an instance of Lady Catherine s condescension  as he knew        not how to admire enough            I confess   said he   that I should not have been at all        surprised by her ladyship s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and        spend the evening at Rosings  I rather expected  from my        knowledge of her affability  that it would happen  But who could        have foreseen such an attention as this  Who could have imagined        that we should receive an invitation to dine there  an        invitation  moreover  including the whole party  so immediately        after your arrival             I am the less surprised at what has happened   replied Sir        William   from that knowledge of what the manners of the great        really are  which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire         About the court  such instances of elegant breeding are not        uncommon            Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but        their visit to Rosings  Mr  Collins was carefully instructing        them in what they were to expect  that the sight of such rooms         so many servants  and so splendid a dinner  might not wholly        overpower them           When the ladies were separating for the toilette  he said to        Elizabeth            Do not make yourself uneasy  my dear cousin  about your apparel         Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us        which becomes herself and her daughter  I would advise you merely        to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there        is no occasion for anything more  Lady Catherine will not think        the worse of you for being simply dressed  She likes to have the        distinction of rank preserved            While they were dressing  he came two or three times to their        different doors  to recommend their being quick  as Lady        Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner         Such formidable accounts of her ladyship  and her manner of        living  quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to        company  and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings        with as much apprehension as her father had done to his        presentation at St  James s           As the weather was fine  they had a pleasant walk of about half a        mile across the park  Every park has its beauty and its        prospects  and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with  though she        could not be in such raptures as Mr  Collins expected the scene        to inspire  and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of        the windows in front of the house  and his relation of what the        glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh           When they ascended the steps to the hall  Maria s alarm was every        moment increasing  and even Sir William did not look perfectly        calm  Elizabeth s courage did not fail her  She had heard nothing        of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary        talents or miraculous virtue  and the mere stateliness of money        or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation           From the entrance hall  of which Mr  Collins pointed out  with a        rapturous air  the fine proportion and the finished ornaments         they followed the servants through an ante chamber  to the room        where Lady Catherine  her daughter  and Mrs  Jenkinson were        sitting  Her ladyship  with great condescension  arose to receive        them  and as Mrs  Collins had settled it with her husband that        the office of introduction should be hers  it was performed in a        proper manner  without any of those apologies and thanks which he        would have thought necessary           In spite of having been at St  James s  Sir William was so        completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him  that he had but        just courage enough to make a very low bow  and take his seat        without saying a word  and his daughter  frightened almost out of        her senses  sat on the edge of her chair  not knowing which way        to look  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene  and        could observe the three ladies before her composedly  Lady        Catherine was a tall  large woman  with strongly marked features         which might once have been handsome  Her air was not        conciliating  nor was her manner of receiving them such as to        make her visitors forget their inferior rank  She was not        rendered formidable by silence  but whatever she said was spoken        in so authoritative a tone  as marked her self importance  and        brought Mr  Wickham immediately to Elizabeth s mind  and from the        observation of the day altogether  she believed Lady Catherine to        be exactly what he represented           When  after examining the mother  in whose countenance and        deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr  Darcy  she        turned her eyes on the daughter  she could almost have joined in        Maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small  There was        neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies  Miss        de Bourgh was pale and sickly  her features  though not plain         were insignificant  and she spoke very little  except in a low        voice  to Mrs  Jenkinson  in whose appearance there was nothing        remarkable  and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she        said  and placing a screen in the proper direction before her        eyes           After sitting a few minutes  they were all sent to one of the        windows to admire the view  Mr  Collins attending them to point        out its beauties  and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that        it was much better worth looking at in the summer           The dinner was exceedingly handsome  and there were all the        servants and all the articles of plate which Mr  Collins had        promised  and  as he had likewise foretold  he took his seat at        the bottom of the table  by her ladyship s desire  and looked as        if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater  He carved         and ate  and praised with delighted alacrity  and every dish was        commended  first by him and then by Sir William  who was now        enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said  in a        manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear  But        Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration         and gave most gracious smiles  especially when any dish on the        table proved a novelty to them  The party did not supply much        conversation  Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an        opening  but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de        Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady        Catherine  and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time         Mrs  Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss        de Bourgh ate  pressing her to try some other dish  and fearing        she was indisposed  Maria thought speaking out of the question         and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire           When the ladies returned to the drawing room  there was little to        be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk  which she did without        any intermission till coffee came in  delivering her opinion on        every subject in so decisive a manner  as proved that she was not        used to have her judgement controverted  She enquired into        Charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely  gave her a        great deal of advice as to the management of them all  told her        how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as        hers  and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her        poultry  Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great        lady s attention  which could furnish her with an occasion of        dictating to others  In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs         Collins  she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and        Elizabeth  but especially to the latter  of whose connections she        knew the least  and who she observed to Mrs  Collins was a very        genteel  pretty kind of girl  She asked her  at different times         how many sisters she had  whether they were older or younger than        herself  whether any of them were likely to be married  whether        they were handsome  where they had been educated  what carriage        her father kept  and what had been her mother s maiden name         Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered        them very composedly  Lady Catherine then observed            Your father s estate is entailed on Mr  Collins  I think  For        your sake   turning to Charlotte   I am glad of it  but otherwise        I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line  It        was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh s family  Do you        play and sing  Miss Bennet             A little             Oh  then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you  Our        instrument is a capital one  probably superior to  You shall try        it some day  Do your sisters play and sing             One of them does             Why did not you all learn  You ought all to have learned  The        Miss Webbs all play  and their father has not so good an income        as yours  Do you draw             No  not at all             What  none of you             Not one             That is very strange  But I suppose you had no opportunity  Your        mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit        of masters             My mother would have had no objection  but my father hates        London             Has your governess left you             We never had any governess             No governess  How was that possible  Five daughters brought up        at home without a governess  I never heard of such a thing  Your        mother must have been quite a slave to your education            Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had        not been the case            Then  who taught you  who attended to you  Without a governess         you must have been neglected             Compared with some families  I believe we were  but such of us        as wished to learn never wanted the means  We were always        encouraged to read  and had all the masters that were necessary         Those who chose to be idle  certainly might             Aye  no doubt  but that is what a governess will prevent  and if        I had known your mother  I should have advised her most        strenuously to engage one  I always say that nothing is to be        done in education without steady and regular instruction  and        nobody but a governess can give it  It is wonderful how many        families I have been the means of supplying in that way  I am        always glad to get a young person well placed out  Four nieces of        Mrs  Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means         and it was but the other day that I recommended another young        person  who was merely accidentally mentioned to me  and the        family are quite delighted with her  Mrs  Collins  did I tell you        of Lady Metcalf s calling yesterday to thank me  She finds Miss        Pope a treasure   Lady Catherine   said she   you have given me a        treasure   Are any of your younger sisters out  Miss Bennet             Yes  ma am  all             All  What  all five out at once  Very odd  And you only the        second  The younger ones out before the elder ones are married         Your younger sisters must be very young             Yes  my youngest is not sixteen  Perhaps  she  is full young to        be much in company  But really  ma am  I think it would be very        hard upon younger sisters  that they should not have their share        of society and amusement  because the elder may not have the        means or inclination to marry early  The last born has as good a        right to the pleasures of youth as the first  And to be kept back        on  such  a motive  I think it would not be very likely to        promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind             Upon my word   said her ladyship   you give your opinion very        decidedly for so young a person  Pray  what is your age             With three younger sisters grown up   replied Elizabeth         smiling   your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it            Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct        answer  and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature        who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence            You cannot be more than twenty  I am sure  therefore you need        not conceal your age             I am not one and twenty            When the gentlemen had joined them  and tea was over  the        card tables were placed  Lady Catherine  Sir William  and Mr  and        Mrs  Collins sat down to quadrille  and as Miss de Bourgh chose        to play at cassino  the two girls had the honour of assisting        Mrs  Jenkinson to make up her party  Their table was        superlatively stupid  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did        not relate to the game  except when Mrs  Jenkinson expressed her        fears of Miss de Bourgh s being too hot or too cold  or having        too much or too little light  A great deal more passed at the        other table  Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the        mistakes of the three others  or relating some anecdote of        herself  Mr  Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her        ladyship said  thanking her for every fish he won  and        apologising if he thought he won too many  Sir William did not        say much  He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble        names           When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they        chose  the tables were broken up  the carriage was offered to        Mrs  Collins  gratefully accepted and immediately ordered  The        party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine        determine what weather they were to have on the morrow  From        these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the        coach  and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr  Collins s        side and as many bows on Sir William s they departed  As soon as        they had driven from the door  Elizabeth was called on by her        cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings         which  for Charlotte s sake  she made more favourable than it        really was  But her commendation  though costing her some        trouble  could by no means satisfy Mr  Collins  and he was very        soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands           Chapter 30          Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford  but his visit was        long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most        comfortably settled  and of her possessing such a husband and        such a neighbour as were not often met with  While Sir William        was with them  Mr  Collins devoted his morning to driving him out        in his gig  and showing him the country  but when he went away         the whole family returned to their usual employments  and        Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her        cousin by the alteration  for the chief of the time between        breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the        garden or in reading and writing  and looking out of the window        in his own book room  which fronted the road  The room in which        the ladies sat was backwards  Elizabeth had at first rather        wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for        common use  it was a better sized room  and had a more pleasant        aspect  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason        for what she did  for Mr  Collins would undoubtedly have been        much less in his own apartment  had they sat in one equally        lively  and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement           From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane         and were indebted to Mr  Collins for the knowledge of what        carriages went along  and how often especially Miss de Bourgh        drove by in her phaeton  which he never failed coming to inform        them of  though it happened almost every day  She not        unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage  and had a few minutes         conversation with Charlotte  but was scarcely ever prevailed upon        to get out           Very few days passed in which Mr  Collins did not walk to        Rosings  and not many in which his wife did not think it        necessary to go likewise  and till Elizabeth recollected that        there might be other family livings to be disposed of  she could        not understand the sacrifice of so many hours  Now and then they        were honoured with a call from her ladyship  and nothing escaped        her observation that was passing in the room during these visits         She examined into their employments  looked at their work  and        advised them to do it differently  found fault with the        arrangement of the furniture  or detected the housemaid in        negligence  and if she accepted any refreshment  seemed to do it        only for the sake of finding out that Mrs  Collins s joints of        meat were too large for her family           Elizabeth soon perceived  that though this great lady was not in        the commission of the peace of the county  she was a most active        magistrate in her own parish  the minutest concerns of which were        carried to her by Mr  Collins  and whenever any of the cottagers        were disposed to be quarrelsome  discontented  or too poor  she        sallied forth into the village to settle their differences         silence their complaints  and scold them into harmony and plenty           The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a        week  and  allowing for the loss of Sir William  and there being        only one card table in the evening  every such entertainment was        the counterpart of the first  Their other engagements were few         as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond        Mr  Collins s reach  This  however  was no evil to Elizabeth  and        upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough  there were        half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte  and the        weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great        enjoyment out of doors  Her favourite walk  and where she        frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine         was along the open grove which edged that side of the park  where        there was a nice sheltered path  which no one seemed to value but        herself  and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine s        curiosity           In this quiet way  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed        away  Easter was approaching  and the week preceding it was to        bring an addition to the family at Rosings  which in so small a        circle must be important  Elizabeth had heard soon after her        arrival that Mr  Darcy was expected there in the course of a few        weeks  and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom        she did not prefer  his coming would furnish one comparatively        new to look at in their Rosings parties  and she might be amused        in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley s designs on him were  by his        behaviour to his cousin  for whom he was evidently destined by        Lady Catherine  who talked of his coming with the greatest        satisfaction  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration         and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been        frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself           His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage  for Mr  Collins was        walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into        Hunsford Lane  in order to have the earliest assurance of it  and        after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park         hurried home with the great intelligence  On the following        morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects  There were        two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them  for Mr  Darcy had        brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam  the younger son of his        uncle Lord     and  to the great surprise of all the party  when        Mr  Collins returned  the gentlemen accompanied him  Charlotte        had seen them from her husband s room  crossing the road  and        immediately running into the other  told the girls what an honour        they might expect  adding            I may thank you  Eliza  for this piece of civility  Mr  Darcy        would never have come so soon to wait upon me            Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the        compliment  before their approach was announced by the door bell         and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room         Colonel Fitzwilliam  who led the way  was about thirty  not        handsome  but in person and address most truly the gentleman  Mr         Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in        Hertfordshire paid his compliments  with his usual reserve  to        Mrs  Collins  and whatever might be his feelings toward her        friend  met her with every appearance of composure  Elizabeth        merely curtseyed to him without saying a word           Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the        readiness and ease of a well bred man  and talked very        pleasantly  but his cousin  after having addressed a slight        observation on the house and garden to Mrs  Collins  sat for some        time without speaking to anybody  At length  however  his        civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the        health of her family  She answered him in the usual way  and        after a moment s pause  added            My eldest sister has been in town these three months  Have you        never happened to see her there            She was perfectly sensible that he never had  but she wished to        see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed        between the Bingleys and Jane  and she thought he looked a little        confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to        meet Miss Bennet  The subject was pursued no farther  and the        gentlemen soon afterwards went away           Chapter 31          Colonel Fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the        Parsonage  and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably        to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings  It was some        days  however  before they received any invitation thither for        while there were visitors in the house  they could not be        necessary  and it was not till Easter day  almost a week after        the gentlemen s arrival  that they were honoured by such an        attention  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to        come there in the evening  For the last week they had seen very        little of Lady Catherine or her daughter  Colonel Fitzwilliam had        called at the Parsonage more than once during the time  but Mr         Darcy they had seen only at church           The invitation was accepted of course  and at a proper hour they        joined the party in Lady Catherine s drawing room  Her ladyship        received them civilly  but it was plain that their company was by        no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else  and she        was  in fact  almost engrossed by her nephews  speaking to them         especially to Darcy  much more than to any other person in the        room           Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them  anything was        a welcome relief to him at Rosings  and Mrs  Collins s pretty        friend had moreover caught his fancy very much  He now seated        himself by her  and talked so agreeably of Kent and        Hertfordshire  of travelling and staying at home  of new books        and music  that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained        in that room before  and they conversed with so much spirit and        flow  as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself  as well        as of Mr  Darcy   His  eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned        towards them with a look of curiosity  and that her ladyship         after a while  shared the feeling  was more openly acknowledged         for she did not scruple to call out            What is that you are saying  Fitzwilliam  What is it you are        talking of  What are you telling Miss Bennet  Let me hear what it        is             We are speaking of music  madam   said he  when no longer able        to avoid a reply            Of music  Then pray speak aloud  It is of all subjects my        delight  I must have my share in the conversation if you are        speaking of music  There are few people in England  I suppose         who have more true enjoyment of music than myself  or a better        natural taste  If I had ever learnt  I should have been a great        proficient  And so would Anne  if her health had allowed her to        apply  I am confident that she would have performed delightfully         How does Georgiana get on  Darcy            Mr  Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s        proficiency            I am very glad to hear such a good account of her   said Lady        Catherine   and pray tell her from me  that she cannot expect to        excel if she does not practice a good deal             I assure you  madam   he replied   that she does not need such        advice  She practises very constantly             So much the better  It cannot be done too much  and when I next        write to her  I shall charge her not to neglect it on any        account  I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is        to be acquired without constant practice  I have told Miss Bennet        several times  that she will never play really well unless she        practises more  and though Mrs  Collins has no instrument  she is        very welcome  as I have often told her  to come to Rosings every        day  and play on the pianoforte in Mrs  Jenkinson s room  She        would be in nobody s way  you know  in that part of the house            Mr  Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding  and        made no answer           When coffee was over  Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of        having promised to play to him  and she sat down directly to the        instrument  He drew a chair near her  Lady Catherine listened to        half a song  and then talked  as before  to her other nephew         till the latter walked away from her  and making with his usual        deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to        command a full view of the fair performer s countenance         Elizabeth saw what he was doing  and at the first convenient        pause  turned to him with an arch smile  and said            You mean to frighten me  Mr  Darcy  by coming in all this state        to hear me  I will not be alarmed though your sister  does  play        so well  There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to        be frightened at the will of others  My courage always rises at        every attempt to intimidate me             I shall not say you are mistaken   he replied   because you        could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming        you  and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough        to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing        opinions which in fact are not your own            Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself  and said        to Colonel Fitzwilliam   Your cousin will give you a very pretty        notion of me  and teach you not to believe a word I say  I am        particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose        my real character  in a part of the world where I had hoped to        pass myself off with some degree of credit  Indeed  Mr  Darcy  it        is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my        disadvantage in Hertfordshire and  give me leave to say  very        impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such        things may come out as will shock your relations to hear             I am not afraid of you   said he  smilingly            Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of   cried Colonel        Fitzwilliam   I should like to know how he behaves among        strangers             You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very        dreadful  The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire         you must know  was at a ball and at this ball  what do you think        he did  He danced only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce         and  to my certain knowledge  more than one young lady was        sitting down in want of a partner  Mr  Darcy  you cannot deny the        fact             I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the        assembly beyond my own party             True  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room  Well         Colonel Fitzwilliam  what do I play next  My fingers wait your        orders             Perhaps   said Darcy   I should have judged better  had I sought        an introduction  but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to        strangers             Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this   said Elizabeth         still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam   Shall we ask him why a man        of sense and education  and who has lived in the world  is ill        qualified to recommend himself to strangers             I can answer your question   said Fitzwilliam   without applying        to him  It is because he will not give himself the trouble             I certainly have not the talent which some people possess   said        Darcy   of conversing easily with those I have never seen before         I cannot catch their tone of conversation  or appear interested        in their concerns  as I often see done             My fingers   said Elizabeth   do not move over this instrument        in the masterly manner which I see so many women s do  They have        not the same force or rapidity  and do not produce the same        expression  But then I have always supposed it to be my own        fault because I will not take the trouble of practising  It is        not that I do not believe  my  fingers as capable as any other        woman s of superior execution            Darcy smiled and said   You are perfectly right  You have        employed your time much better  No one admitted to the privilege        of hearing you can think anything wanting  We neither of us        perform to strangers            Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine  who called out to        know what they were talking of  Elizabeth immediately began        playing again  Lady Catherine approached  and  after listening        for a few minutes  said to Darcy            Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more         and could have the advantage of a London master  She has a very        good notion of fingering  though her taste is not equal to        Anne s  Anne would have been a delightful performer  had her        health allowed her to learn            Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his        cousin s praise  but neither at that moment nor at any other        could she discern any symptom of love  and from the whole of his        behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss        Bingley  that he might have been just as likely to marry  her          had she been his relation           Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth s performance         mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste         Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility         and  at the request of the gentlemen  remained at the instrument        till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home           Chapter 32          Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning  and writing to        Jane while Mrs  Collins and Maria were gone on business into the        village  when she was startled by a ring at the door  the certain        signal of a visitor  As she had heard no carriage  she thought it        not unlikely to be Lady Catherine  and under that apprehension        was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape        all impertinent questions  when the door opened  and  to her very        great surprise  Mr  Darcy  and Mr  Darcy only  entered the room           He seemed astonished too on finding her alone  and apologised for        his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the        ladies were to be within           They then sat down  and when her enquiries after Rosings were        made  seemed in danger of sinking into total silence  It was        absolutely necessary  therefore  to think of something  and in        this emergence recollecting  when  she had seen him last in        Hertfordshire  and feeling curious to know what he would say on        the subject of their hasty departure  she observed            How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November  Mr         Darcy  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr  Bingley        to see you all after him so soon  for  if I recollect right  he        went but the day before  He and his sisters were well  I hope         when you left London             Perfectly so  I thank you            She found that she was to receive no other answer  and  after a        short pause added            I think I have understood that Mr  Bingley has not much idea of        ever returning to Netherfield again             I have never heard him say so  but it is probable that he may        spend very little of his time there in the future  He has many        friends  and is at a time of life when friends and engagements        are continually increasing             If he means to be but little at Netherfield  it would be better        for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely         for then we might possibly get a settled family there  But         perhaps  Mr  Bingley did not take the house so much for the        convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own  and we must        expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle             I should not be surprised   said Darcy   if he were to give it        up as soon as any eligible purchase offers            Elizabeth made no answer  She was afraid of talking longer of his        friend  and  having nothing else to say  was now determined to        leave the trouble of finding a subject to him           He took the hint  and soon began with   This seems a very        comfortable house  Lady Catherine  I believe  did a great deal to        it when Mr  Collins first came to Hunsford             I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her        kindness on a more grateful object             Mr  Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a        wife             Yes  indeed  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with        one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him         or have made him happy if they had  My friend has an excellent        understanding though I am not certain that I consider her        marrying Mr  Collins as the wisest thing she ever did  She seems        perfectly happy  however  and in a prudential light it is        certainly a very good match for her             It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a        distance of her own family and friends             An easy distance  do you call it  It is nearly fifty miles             And what is fifty miles of good road  Little more than half a        day s journey  Yes  I call it a very easy distance             I should never have considered the distance as one of the         advantages  of the match   cried Elizabeth   I should never have        said Mrs  Collins was settled  near  her family             It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire  Anything        beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn  I suppose  would        appear far            As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she        understood  he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and        Netherfield  and she blushed as she answered            I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near        her family  The far and the near must be relative  and depend on        many varying circumstances  Where there is fortune to make the        expenses of travelling unimportant  distance becomes no evil  But        that is not the case  here   Mr  and Mrs  Collins have a        comfortable income  but not such a one as will allow of frequent        journeys and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself         near  her family under less than  half  the present distance            Mr  Darcy drew his chair a little towards her  and said    You         cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment   You         cannot have been always at Longbourn            Elizabeth looked surprised  The gentleman experienced some change        of feeling  he drew back his chair  took a newspaper from the        table  and glancing over it  said  in a colder voice            Are you pleased with Kent            A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued  on either        side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of        Charlotte and her sister  just returned from her walk  The         t te   t te  surprised them  Mr  Darcy related the mistake which        had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet  and after sitting a        few minutes longer without saying much to anybody  went away            What can be the meaning of this   said Charlotte  as soon as he        was gone   My dear  Eliza  he must be in love with you  or he        would never have called on us in this familiar way            But when Elizabeth told of his silence  it did not seem very        likely  even to Charlotte s wishes  to be the case  and after        various conjectures  they could at last only suppose his visit to        proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do  which was        the more probable from the time of year  All field sports were        over  Within doors there was Lady Catherine  books  and a        billiard table  but gentlemen cannot always be within doors  and        in the nearness of the Parsonage  or the pleasantness of the walk        to it  or of the people who lived in it  the two cousins found a        temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day         They called at various times of the morning  sometimes        separately  sometimes together  and now and then accompanied by        their aunt  It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam        came because he had pleasure in their society  a persuasion which        of course recommended him still more  and Elizabeth was reminded        by her own satisfaction in being with him  as well as by his        evident admiration of her  of her former favourite George        Wickham  and though  in comparing them  she saw there was less        captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam s manners  she        believed he might have the best informed mind           But why Mr  Darcy came so often to the Parsonage  it was more        difficult to understand  It could not be for society  as he        frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his        lips  and when he did speak  it seemed the effect of necessity        rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety  not a pleasure to        himself  He seldom appeared really animated  Mrs  Collins knew        not what to make of him  Colonel Fitzwilliam s occasionally        laughing at his stupidity  proved that he was generally        different  which her own knowledge of him could not have told        her  and as she would liked to have believed this change the        effect of love  and the object of that love her friend Eliza  she        set herself seriously to work to find it out  She watched him        whenever they were at Rosings  and whenever he came to Hunsford         but without much success  He certainly looked at her friend a        great deal  but the expression of that look was disputable  It        was an earnest  steadfast gaze  but she often doubted whether        there were much admiration in it  and sometimes it seemed nothing        but absence of mind           She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of        his being partial to her  but Elizabeth always laughed at the        idea  and Mrs  Collins did not think it right to press the        subject  from the danger of raising expectations which might only        end in disappointment  for in her opinion it admitted not of a        doubt  that all her friend s dislike would vanish  if she could        suppose him to be in her power           In her kind schemes for Elizabeth  she sometimes planned her        marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam  He was beyond comparison the most        pleasant man  he certainly admired her  and his situation in life        was most eligible  but  to counterbalance these advantages  Mr         Darcy had considerable patronage in the church  and his cousin        could have none at all           Chapter 33          More than once did Elizabeth  in her ramble within the park         unexpectedly meet Mr  Darcy  She felt all the perverseness of the        mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought         and  to prevent its ever happening again  took care to inform him        at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers  How it could        occur a second time  therefore  was very odd  Yet it did  and        even a third  It seemed like wilful ill nature  or a voluntary        penance  for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal        enquiries and an awkward pause and then away  but he actually        thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her  He never        said a great deal  nor did she give herself the trouble of        talking or of listening much  but it struck her in the course of        their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected        questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford  her love of        solitary walks  and her opinion of Mr  and Mrs  Collins s        happiness  and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly        understanding the house  he seemed to expect that whenever she        came into Kent again she would be staying  there  too  His words        seemed to imply it  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his        thoughts  She supposed  if he meant anything  he must mean an        allusion to what might arise in that quarter  It distressed her a        little  and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the        pales opposite the Parsonage           She was engaged one day as she walked  in perusing Jane s last        letter  and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had        not written in spirits  when  instead of being again surprised by        Mr  Darcy  she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was        meeting her  Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a        smile  she said            I did not know before that you ever walked this way             I have been making the tour of the park   he replied   as I        generally do every year  and intend to close it with a call at        the Parsonage  Are you going much farther             No  I should have turned in a moment            And accordingly she did turn  and they walked towards the        Parsonage together            Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday   said she            Yes if Darcy does not put it off again  But I am at his        disposal  He arranges the business just as he pleases             And if not able to please himself in the arrangement  he has at        least pleasure in the great power of choice  I do not know        anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes        than Mr  Darcy             He likes to have his own way very well   replied Colonel        Fitzwilliam   But so we all do  It is only that he has better        means of having it than many others  because he is rich  and many        others are poor  I speak feelingly  A younger son  you know  must        be inured to self denial and dependence             In my opinion  the younger son of an earl can know very little        of either  Now seriously  what have you ever known of self denial        and dependence  When have you been prevented by want of money        from going wherever you chose  or procuring anything you had a        fancy for             These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have        experienced many hardships of that nature  But in matters of        greater weight  I may suffer from want of money  Younger sons        cannot marry where they like             Unless where they like women of fortune  which I think they very        often do             Our habits of expense make us too dependent  and there are not        many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some        attention to money             Is this   thought Elizabeth   meant for me   and she coloured at        the idea  but  recovering herself  said in a lively tone   And        pray  what is the usual price of an earl s younger son  Unless        the elder brother is very sickly  I suppose you would not ask        above fifty thousand pounds            He answered her in the same style  and the subject dropped  To        interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with        what had passed  she soon afterwards said            I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the        sake of having someone at his disposal  I wonder he does not        marry  to secure a lasting convenience of that kind  But         perhaps  his sister does as well for the present  and  as she is        under his sole care  he may do what he likes with her             No   said Colonel Fitzwilliam   that is an advantage which he        must divide with me  I am joined with him in the guardianship of        Miss Darcy             Are you indeed  And pray what sort of guardians do you make         Does your charge give you much trouble  Young ladies of her age        are sometimes a little difficult to manage  and if she has the        true Darcy spirit  she may like to have her own way            As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly  and the        manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss        Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness  convinced her that she        had somehow or other got pretty near the truth  She directly        replied            You need not be frightened  I never heard any harm of her  and I        dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world         She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my        acquaintance  Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley  I think I have heard        you say that you know them             I know them a little  Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike        man he is a great friend of Darcy s             Oh  yes   said Elizabeth drily   Mr  Darcy is uncommonly kind to        Mr  Bingley  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him             Care of him  Yes  I really believe Darcy  does  take care of him        in those points where he most wants care  From something that he        told me in our journey hither  I have reason to think Bingley        very much indebted to him  But I ought to beg his pardon  for I        have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant  It        was all conjecture             What is it you mean             It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally        known  because if it were to get round to the lady s family  it        would be an unpleasant thing             You may depend upon my not mentioning it             And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be        Bingley  What he told me was merely this  that he congratulated        himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences        of a most imprudent marriage  but without mentioning names or any        other particulars  and I only suspected it to be Bingley from        believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that        sort  and from knowing them to have been together the whole of        last summer             Did Mr  Darcy give you reasons for this interference             I understood that there were some very strong objections against        the lady             And what arts did he use to separate them             He did not talk to me of his own arts   said Fitzwilliam         smiling   He only told me what I have now told you            Elizabeth made no answer  and walked on  her heart swelling with        indignation  After watching her a little  Fitzwilliam asked her        why she was so thoughtful            I am thinking of what you have been telling me   said she   Your        cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings  Why was he to be the        judge             You are rather disposed to call his interference officious             I do not see what right Mr  Darcy had to decide on the propriety        of his friend s inclination  or why  upon his own judgement        alone  he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend        was to be happy  But   she continued  recollecting herself   as        we know none of the particulars  it is not fair to condemn him         It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the        case             That is not an unnatural surmise   said Fitzwilliam   but it is        a lessening of the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly            This was spoken jestingly  but it appeared to her so just a        picture of Mr  Darcy  that she would not trust herself with an        answer  and therefore  abruptly changing the conversation talked        on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage  There         shut into her own room  as soon as their visitor left them  she        could think without interruption of all that she had heard  It        was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than        those with whom she was connected  There could not exist in the        world  two  men over whom Mr  Darcy could have such boundless        influence  That he had been concerned in the measures taken to        separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted  but she had        always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and        arrangement of them  If his own vanity  however  did not mislead        him   he  was the cause  his pride and caprice were the cause  of        all that Jane had suffered  and still continued to suffer  He had        ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most        affectionate  generous heart in the world  and no one could say        how lasting an evil he might have inflicted            There were some very strong objections against the lady   were        Colonel Fitzwilliam s words  and those strong objections probably        were  her having one uncle who was a country attorney  and        another who was in business in London            To Jane herself   she exclaimed   there could be no possibility        of objection  all loveliness and goodness as she is  her        understanding excellent  her mind improved  and her manners        captivating  Neither could anything be urged against my father         who  though with some peculiarities  has abilities Mr  Darcy        himself need not disdain  and respectability which he will        probably never reach   When she thought of her mother  her        confidence gave way a little  but she would not allow that any        objections  there  had material weight with Mr  Darcy  whose        pride  she was convinced  would receive a deeper wound from the        want of importance in his friend s connections  than from their        want of sense  and she was quite decided  at last  that he had        been partly governed by this worst kind of pride  and partly by        the wish of retaining Mr  Bingley for his sister           The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned  brought on        a headache  and it grew so much worse towards the evening  that         added to her unwillingness to see Mr  Darcy  it determined her        not to attend her cousins to Rosings  where they were engaged to        drink tea  Mrs  Collins  seeing that she was really unwell  did        not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband        from pressing her  but Mr  Collins could not conceal his        apprehension of Lady Catherine s being rather displeased by her        staying at home           Chapter 34          When they were gone  Elizabeth  as if intending to exasperate        herself as much as possible against Mr  Darcy  chose for her        employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had        written to her since her being in Kent  They contained no actual        complaint  nor was there any revival of past occurrences  or any        communication of present suffering  But in all  and in almost        every line of each  there was a want of that cheerfulness which        had been used to characterise her style  and which  proceeding        from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly        disposed towards everyone  had been scarcely ever clouded         Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of        uneasiness  with an attention which it had hardly received on the        first perusal  Mr  Darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had        been able to inflict  gave her a keener sense of her sister s        sufferings  It was some consolation to think that his visit to        Rosings was to end on the day after the next and  a still        greater  that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with        Jane again  and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her        spirits  by all that affection could do           She could not think of Darcy s leaving Kent without remembering        that his cousin was to go with him  but Colonel Fitzwilliam had        made it clear that he had no intentions at all  and agreeable as        he was  she did not mean to be unhappy about him           While settling this point  she was suddenly roused by the sound        of the door bell  and her spirits were a little fluttered by the        idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself  who had once        before called late in the evening  and might now come to enquire        particularly after her  But this idea was soon banished  and her        spirits were very differently affected  when  to her utter        amazement  she saw Mr  Darcy walk into the room  In an hurried        manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health  imputing        his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better  She answered        him with cold civility  He sat down for a few moments  and then        getting up  walked about the room  Elizabeth was surprised  but        said not a word  After a silence of several minutes  he came        towards her in an agitated manner  and thus began            In vain I have struggled  It will not do  My feelings will not        be repressed  You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire        and love you            Elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression  She stared         coloured  doubted  and was silent  This he considered sufficient        encouragement  and the avowal of all that he felt  and had long        felt for her  immediately followed  He spoke well  but there were        feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed  and he was        not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride  His        sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family        obstacles which had always opposed to inclination  were dwelt on        with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was        wounding  but was very unlikely to recommend his suit           In spite of her deeply rooted dislike  she could not be        insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection  and        though her intentions did not vary for an instant  she was at        first sorry for the pain he was to receive  till  roused to        resentment by his subsequent language  she lost all compassion in        anger  She tried  however  to compose herself to answer him with        patience  when he should have done  He concluded with        representing to her the strength of that attachment which  in        spite of all his endeavours  he had found impossible to conquer         and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her        acceptance of his hand  As he said this  she could easily see        that he had no doubt of a favourable answer  He  spoke  of        apprehension and anxiety  but his countenance expressed real        security  Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther  and         when he ceased  the colour rose into her cheeks  and she said            In such cases as this  it is  I believe  the established mode to        express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed  however        unequally they may be returned  It is natural that obligation        should be felt  and if I could  feel  gratitude  I would now        thank you  But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion         and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly  I am sorry        to have occasioned pain to anyone  It has been most unconsciously        done  however  and I hope will be of short duration  The feelings        which  you tell me  have long prevented the acknowledgment of        your regard  can have little difficulty in overcoming it after        this explanation            Mr  Darcy  who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes        fixed on her face  seemed to catch her words with no less        resentment than surprise  His complexion became pale with anger         and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature  He        was struggling for the appearance of composure  and would not        open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it  The        pause was to Elizabeth s feelings dreadful  At length  with a        voice of forced calmness  he said            And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of        expecting  I might  perhaps  wish to be informed why  with so        little  endeavour  at civility  I am thus rejected  But it is of        small importance             I might as well enquire   replied she   why with so evident a        desire of offending and insulting me  you chose to tell me that        you liked me against your will  against your reason  and even        against your character  Was not this some excuse for incivility         if I  was  uncivil  But I have other provocations  You know I        have  Had not my feelings decided against you had they been        indifferent  or had they even been favourable  do you think that        any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been        the means of ruining  perhaps for ever  the happiness of a most        beloved sister            As she pronounced these words  Mr  Darcy changed colour  but the        emotion was short  and he listened without attempting to        interrupt her while she continued            I have every reason in the world to think ill of you  No motive        can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted  there   You        dare not  you cannot deny  that you have been the principal  if        not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing        one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability  and        the other to its derision for disappointed hopes  and involving        them both in misery of the acutest kind            She paused  and saw with no slight indignation that he was        listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any        feeling of remorse  He even looked at her with a smile of        affected incredulity            Can you deny that you have done it   she repeated           With assumed tranquillity he then replied   I have no wish of        denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend        from your sister  or that I rejoice in my success  Towards  him         I have been kinder than towards myself            Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil        reflection  but its meaning did not escape  nor was it likely to        conciliate her            But it is not merely this affair   she continued   on which my        dislike is founded  Long before it had taken place my opinion of        you was decided  Your character was unfolded in the recital which        I received many months ago from Mr  Wickham  On this subject         what can you have to say  In what imaginary act of friendship can        you here defend yourself  or under what misrepresentation can you        here impose upon others             You take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns   said        Darcy  in a less tranquil tone  and with a heightened colour            Who that knows what his misfortunes have been  can help feeling        an interest in him             His misfortunes   repeated Darcy contemptuously   yes  his        misfortunes have been great indeed             And of your infliction   cried Elizabeth with energy   You have        reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty         You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been        designed for him  You have deprived the best years of his life of        that independence which was no less his due than his desert  You        have done all this  and yet you can treat the mention of his        misfortune with contempt and ridicule             And this   cried Darcy  as he walked with quick steps across the        room   is your opinion of me  This is the estimation in which you        hold me  I thank you for explaining it so fully  My faults         according to this calculation  are heavy indeed  But perhaps          added he  stopping in his walk  and turning towards her   these        offenses might have been overlooked  had not your pride been hurt        by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented        my forming any serious design  These bitter accusations might        have been suppressed  had I  with greater policy  concealed my        struggles  and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled        by unqualified  unalloyed inclination  by reason  by reflection         by everything  But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence  Nor        am I ashamed of the feelings I related  They were natural and        just  Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your        connections  to congratulate myself on the hope of relations         whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own            Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment  yet she        tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said            You are mistaken  Mr  Darcy  if you suppose that the mode of        your declaration affected me in any other way  than as it spared        me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you  had you        behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner            She saw him start at this  but he said nothing  and she        continued            You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible        way that would have tempted me to accept it            Again his astonishment was obvious  and he looked at her with an        expression of mingled incredulity and mortification  She went on            From the very beginning from the first moment  I may almost        say of my acquaintance with you  your manners  impressing me with        the fullest belief of your arrogance  your conceit  and your        selfish disdain of the feelings of others  were such as to form        the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have        built so immovable a dislike  and I had not known you a month        before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I        could ever be prevailed on to marry             You have said quite enough  madam  I perfectly comprehend your        feelings  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have        been  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time  and        accept my best wishes for your health and happiness            And with these words he hastily left the room  and Elizabeth        heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house           The tumult of her mind  was now painfully great  She knew not how        to support herself  and from actual weakness sat down and cried        for half an hour  Her astonishment  as she reflected on what had        passed  was increased by every review of it  That she should        receive an offer of marriage from Mr  Darcy  That he should have        been in love with her for so many months  So much in love as to        wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made        him prevent his friend s marrying her sister  and which must        appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost        incredible  It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so        strong an affection  But his pride  his abominable pride his        shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane his        unpardonable assurance in acknowledging  though he could not        justify it  and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned        Mr  Wickham  his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to        deny  soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his        attachment had for a moment excited  She continued in very        agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine s carriage        made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte s        observation  and hurried her away to her room           Chapter 35          Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and        meditations which had at length closed her eyes  She could not        yet recover from the surprise of what had happened  it was        impossible to think of anything else  and  totally indisposed for        employment  she resolved  soon after breakfast  to indulge        herself in air and exercise  She was proceeding directly to her        favourite walk  when the recollection of Mr  Darcy s sometimes        coming there stopped her  and instead of entering the park  she        turned up the lane  which led farther from the turnpike road  The        park paling was still the boundary on one side  and she soon        passed one of the gates into the ground           After walking two or three times along that part of the lane  she        was tempted  by the pleasantness of the morning  to stop at the        gates and look into the park  The five weeks which she had now        passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country  and        every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees  She was        on the point of continuing her walk  when she caught a glimpse of        a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park  he was        moving that way  and  fearful of its being Mr  Darcy  she was        directly retreating  But the person who advanced was now near        enough to see her  and stepping forward with eagerness         pronounced her name  She had turned away  but on hearing herself        called  though in a voice which proved it to be Mr  Darcy  she        moved again towards the gate  He had by that time reached it        also  and  holding out a letter  which she instinctively took         said  with a look of haughty composure   I have been walking in        the grove some time in the hope of meeting you  Will you do me        the honour of reading that letter   And then  with a slight bow         turned again into the plantation  and was soon out of sight           With no expectation of pleasure  but with the strongest        curiosity  Elizabeth opened the letter  and  to her still        increasing wonder  perceived an envelope containing two sheets of        letter paper  written quite through  in a very close hand  The        envelope itself was likewise full  Pursuing her way along the        lane  she then began it  It was dated from Rosings  at eight        o clock in the morning  and was as follows             Be not alarmed  madam  on receiving this letter  by the        apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments        or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to        you  I write without any intention of paining you  or humbling        myself  by dwelling on wishes which  for the happiness of both         cannot be too soon forgotten  and the effort which the formation        and the perusal of this letter must occasion  should have been        spared  had not my character required it to be written and read         You must  therefore  pardon the freedom with which I demand your        attention  your feelings  I know  will bestow it unwillingly  but        I demand it of your justice            Two offenses of a very different nature  and by no means of        equal magnitude  you last night laid to my charge  The first        mentioned was  that  regardless of the sentiments of either  I        had detached Mr  Bingley from your sister  and the other  that I        had  in defiance of various claims  in defiance of honour and        humanity  ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the        prospects of Mr  Wickham  Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown        off the companion of my youth  the acknowledged favourite of my        father  a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on        our patronage  and who had been brought up to expect its        exertion  would be a depravity  to which the separation of two        young persons  whose affection could be the growth of only a few        weeks  could bear no comparison  But from the severity of that        blame which was last night so liberally bestowed  respecting each        circumstance  I shall hope to be in the future secured  when the        following account of my actions and their motives has been read         If  in the explanation of them  which is due to myself  I am        under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive        to yours  I can only say that I am sorry  The necessity must be        obeyed  and further apology would be absurd            I had not been long in Hertfordshire  before I saw  in common        with others  that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any        other young woman in the country  But it was not till the evening        of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his        feeling a serious attachment  I had often seen him in love        before  At that ball  while I had the honour of dancing with you         I was first made acquainted  by Sir William Lucas s accidental        information  that Bingley s attentions to your sister had given        rise to a general expectation of their marriage  He spoke of it        as a certain event  of which the time alone could be undecided         From that moment I observed my friend s behaviour attentively         and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was        beyond what I had ever witnessed in him  Your sister I also        watched  Her look and manners were open  cheerful  and engaging        as ever  but without any symptom of peculiar regard  and I        remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny  that though she        received his attentions with pleasure  she did not invite them by        any participation of sentiment  If  you  have not been mistaken        here   I  must have been in error  Your superior knowledge of        your sister must make the latter probable  If it be so  if I have        been misled by such error to inflict pain on her  your resentment        has not been unreasonable  But I shall not scruple to assert         that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such        as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that         however amiable her temper  her heart was not likely to be easily        touched  That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is        certain but I will venture to say that my investigation and        decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears  I did        not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it  I believed        it on impartial conviction  as truly as I wished it in reason  My        objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last        night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion        to put aside  in my own case  the want of connection could not be        so great an evil to my friend as to me  But there were other        causes of repugnance  causes which  though still existing  and        existing to an equal degree in both instances  I had myself        endeavoured to forget  because they were not immediately before        me  These causes must be stated  though briefly  The situation of        your mother s family  though objectionable  was nothing in        comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently  so        almost uniformly betrayed by herself  by your three younger        sisters  and occasionally even by your father  Pardon me  It        pains me to offend you  But amidst your concern for the defects        of your nearest relations  and your displeasure at this        representation of them  let it give you consolation to consider        that  to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of        the like censure  is praise no less generally bestowed on you and        your elder sister  than it is honourable to the sense and        disposition of both  I will only say farther that from what        passed that evening  my opinion of all parties was confirmed  and        every inducement heightened which could have led me before  to        preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy        connection  He left Netherfield for London  on the day following         as you  I am certain  remember  with the design of soon        returning            The part which I acted is now to be explained  His sisters         uneasiness had been equally excited with my own  our coincidence        of feeling was soon discovered  and  alike sensible that no time        was to be lost in detaching their brother  we shortly resolved on        joining him directly in London  We accordingly went and there I        readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the        certain evils of such a choice  I described  and enforced them        earnestly  But  however this remonstrance might have staggered or        delayed his determination  I do not suppose that it would        ultimately have prevented the marriage  had it not been seconded        by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving  of your sister s        indifference  He had before believed her to return his affection        with sincere  if not with equal regard  But Bingley has great        natural modesty  with a stronger dependence on my judgement than        on his own  To convince him  therefore  that he had deceived        himself  was no very difficult point  To persuade him against        returning into Hertfordshire  when that conviction had been        given  was scarcely the work of a moment  I cannot blame myself        for having done thus much  There is but one part of my conduct in        the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction  it        is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to        conceal from him your sister s being in town  I knew it myself         as it was known to Miss Bingley  but her brother is even yet        ignorant of it  That they might have met without ill consequence        is perhaps probable  but his regard did not appear to me enough        extinguished for him to see her without some danger  Perhaps this        concealment  this disguise was beneath me  it is done  however         and it was done for the best  On this subject I have nothing more        to say  no other apology to offer  If I have wounded your        sister s feelings  it was unknowingly done and though the motives        which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient         I have not yet learnt to condemn them            With respect to that other  more weighty accusation  of having        injured Mr  Wickham  I can only refute it by laying before you        the whole of his connection with my family  Of what he has         particularly  accused me I am ignorant  but of the truth of what        I shall relate  I can summon more than one witness of undoubted        veracity            Mr  Wickham is the son of a very respectable man  who had for        many years the management of all the Pemberley estates  and whose        good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my        father to be of service to him  and on George Wickham  who was        his godson  his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed  My        father supported him at school  and afterwards at Cambridge most        important assistance  as his own father  always poor from the        extravagance of his wife  would have been unable to give him a        gentleman s education  My father was not only fond of this young        man s society  whose manners were always engaging  he had also        the highest opinion of him  and hoping the church would be his        profession  intended to provide for him in it  As for myself  it        is many  many years since I first began to think of him in a very        different manner  The vicious propensities the want of principle         which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best        friend  could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly        the same age with himself  and who had opportunities of seeing        him in unguarded moments  which Mr  Darcy could not have  Here        again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell  But        whatever may be the sentiments which Mr  Wickham has created  a        suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his        real character it adds even another motive            My excellent father died about five years ago  and his        attachment to Mr  Wickham was to the last so steady  that in his        will he particularly recommended it to me  to promote his        advancement in the best manner that his profession might        allow and if he took orders  desired that a valuable family        living might be his as soon as it became vacant  There was also a        legacy of one thousand pounds  His own father did not long        survive mine  and within half a year from these events  Mr         Wickham wrote to inform me that  having finally resolved against        taking orders  he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for        him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage  in lieu of        the preferment  by which he could not be benefited  He had some        intention  he added  of studying law  and I must be aware that        the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient        support therein  I rather wished  than believed him to be        sincere  but  at any rate  was perfectly ready to accede to his        proposal  I knew that Mr  Wickham ought not to be a clergyman         the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to        assistance in the church  were it possible that he could ever be        in a situation to receive it  and accepted in return three        thousand pounds  All connection between us seemed now dissolved         I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley  or admit his        society in town  In town I believe he chiefly lived  but his        studying the law was a mere pretence  and being now free from all        restraint  his life was a life of idleness and dissipation  For        about three years I heard little of him  but on the decease of        the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him  he        applied to me again by letter for the presentation  His        circumstances  he assured me  and I had no difficulty in        believing it  were exceedingly bad  He had found the law a most        unprofitable study  and was now absolutely resolved on being        ordained  if I would present him to the living in question of        which he trusted there could be little doubt  as he was well        assured that I had no other person to provide for  and I could        not have forgotten my revered father s intentions  You will        hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty  or for        resisting every repetition to it  His resentment was in        proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was        doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his        reproaches to myself  After this period every appearance of        acquaintance was dropped  How he lived I know not  But last        summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice            I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget        myself  and which no obligation less than the present should        induce me to unfold to any human being  Having said thus much  I        feel no doubt of your secrecy  My sister  who is more than ten        years my junior  was left to the guardianship of my mother s        nephew  Colonel Fitzwilliam  and myself  About a year ago  she        was taken from school  and an establishment formed for her in        London  and last summer she went with the lady who presided over        it  to Ramsgate  and thither also went Mr  Wickham  undoubtedly        by design  for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance        between him and Mrs  Younge  in whose character we were most        unhappily deceived  and by her connivance and aid  he so far        recommended himself to Georgiana  whose affectionate heart        retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child         that she was persuaded to believe herself in love  and to consent        to an elopement  She was then but fifteen  which must be her        excuse  and after stating her imprudence  I am happy to add  that        I owed the knowledge of it to herself  I joined them unexpectedly        a day or two before the intended elopement  and then Georgiana         unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother        whom she almost looked up to as a father  acknowledged the whole        to me  You may imagine what I felt and how I acted  Regard for my        sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure  but I        wrote to Mr  Wickham  who left the place immediately  and Mrs         Younge was of course removed from her charge  Mr  Wickham s chief        object was unquestionably my sister s fortune  which is thirty        thousand pounds  but I cannot help supposing that the hope of        revenging himself on me was a strong inducement  His revenge        would have been complete indeed            This  madam  is a faithful narrative of every event in which we        have been concerned together  and if you do not absolutely reject        it as false  you will  I hope  acquit me henceforth of cruelty        towards Mr  Wickham  I know not in what manner  under what form        of falsehood he had imposed on you  but his success is not        perhaps to be wondered at  Ignorant as you previously were of        everything concerning either  detection could not be in your        power  and suspicion certainly not in your inclination            You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last        night  but I was not then master enough of myself to know what        could or ought to be revealed  For the truth of everything here        related  I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of        Colonel Fitzwilliam  who  from our near relationship and constant        intimacy  and  still more  as one of the executors of my father s        will  has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of        these transactions  If your abhorrence of  me  should make  my         assertions valueless  you cannot be prevented by the same cause        from confiding in my cousin  and that there may be the        possibility of consulting him  I shall endeavour to find some        opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of        the morning  I will only add  God bless you            FITZWILLIAM DARCY           Chapter 36          If Elizabeth  when Mr  Darcy gave her the letter  did not expect        it to contain a renewal of his offers  she had formed no        expectation at all of its contents  But such as they were  it may        well be supposed how eagerly she went through them  and what a        contrariety of emotion they excited  Her feelings as she read        were scarcely to be defined  With amazement did she first        understand that he believed any apology to be in his power  and        steadfastly was she persuaded  that he could have no explanation        to give  which a just sense of shame would not conceal  With a        strong prejudice against everything he might say  she began his        account of what had happened at Netherfield  She read with an        eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension  and from        impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring  was        incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes         His belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved        to be false  and his account of the real  the worst objections to        the match  made her too angry to have any wish of doing him        justice  He expressed no regret for what he had done which        satisfied her  his style was not penitent  but haughty  It was        all pride and insolence           But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr         Wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation        of events which  if true  must overthrow every cherished opinion        of his worth  and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own        history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and        more difficult of definition  Astonishment  apprehension  and        even horror  oppressed her  She wished to discredit it entirely         repeatedly exclaiming   This must be false  This cannot be  This        must be the grossest falsehood   and when she had gone through        the whole letter  though scarcely knowing anything of the last        page or two  put it hastily away  protesting that she would not        regard it  that she would never look in it again           In this perturbed state of mind  with thoughts that could rest on        nothing  she walked on  but it would not do  in half a minute the        letter was unfolded again  and collecting herself as well as she        could  she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related        to Wickham  and commanded herself so far as to examine the        meaning of every sentence  The account of his connection with the        Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself  and the        kindness of the late Mr  Darcy  though she had not before known        its extent  agreed equally well with his own words  So far each        recital confirmed the other  but when she came to the will  the        difference was great  What Wickham had said of the living was        fresh in her memory  and as she recalled his very words  it was        impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side        or the other  and  for a few moments  she flattered herself that        her wishes did not err  But when she read and re read with the        closest attention  the particulars immediately following of        Wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living  of his        receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds         again was she forced to hesitate  She put down the letter         weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be        impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but        with little success  On both sides it was only assertion  Again        she read on  but every line proved more clearly that the affair         which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could        so represent as to render Mr  Darcy s conduct in it less than        infamous  was capable of a turn which must make him entirely        blameless throughout the whole           The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to        lay at Mr  Wickham s charge  exceedingly shocked her  the more        so  as she could bring no proof of its injustice  She had never        heard of him before his entrance into the   shire Militia  in        which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who  on        meeting him accidentally in town  had there renewed a slight        acquaintance  Of his former way of life nothing had been known in        Hertfordshire but what he told himself  As to his real character         had information been in her power  she had never felt a wish of        enquiring  His countenance  voice  and manner had established him        at once in the possession of every virtue  She tried to recollect        some instance of goodness  some distinguished trait of integrity        or benevolence  that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr         Darcy  or at least  by the predominance of virtue  atone for        those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what        Mr  Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years         continuance  But no such recollection befriended her  She could        see him instantly before her  in every charm of air and address         but she could remember no more substantial good than the general        approbation of the neighbourhood  and the regard which his social        powers had gained him in the mess  After pausing on this point a        considerable while  she once more continued to read  But  alas         the story which followed  of his designs on Miss Darcy  received        some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel        Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before  and at last she        was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel        Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the        information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs  and        whose character she had no reason to question  At one time she        had almost resolved on applying to him  but the idea was checked        by the awkwardness of the application  and at length wholly        banished by the conviction that Mr  Darcy would never have        hazarded such a proposal  if he had not been well assured of his        cousin s corroboration           She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in        conversation between Wickham and herself  in their first evening        at Mr  Phillips s  Many of his expressions were still fresh in        her memory  She was  now  struck with the impropriety of such        communications to a stranger  and wondered it had escaped her        before  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he        had done  and the inconsistency of his professions with his        conduct  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of        seeing Mr  Darcy that Mr  Darcy might leave the country  but that         he  should stand his ground  yet he had avoided the Netherfield        ball the very next week  She remembered also that  till the        Netherfield family had quitted the country  he had told his story        to no one but herself  but that after their removal it had been        everywhere discussed  that he had then no reserves  no scruples        in sinking Mr  Darcy s character  though he had assured her that        respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son           How differently did everything now appear in which he was        concerned  His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence        of views solely and hatefully mercenary  and the mediocrity of        her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes  but        his eagerness to grasp at anything  His behaviour to herself        could now have had no tolerable motive  he had either been        deceived with regard to her fortune  or had been gratifying his        vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had        most incautiously shown  Every lingering struggle in his favour        grew fainter and fainter  and in farther justification of Mr         Darcy  she could not but allow that Mr  Bingley  when questioned        by Jane  had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair         that proud and repulsive as were his manners  she had never  in        the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had        latterly brought them much together  and given her a sort of        intimacy with his ways seen anything that betrayed him to be        unprincipled or unjust anything that spoke him of irreligious or        immoral habits  that among his own connections he was esteemed        and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother         and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his        sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling  that had        his actions been what Mr  Wickham represented them  so gross a        violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed        from the world  and that friendship between a person capable of        it  and such an amiable man as Mr  Bingley  was incomprehensible           She grew absolutely ashamed of herself  Of neither Darcy nor        Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind         partial  prejudiced  absurd            How despicably I have acted   she cried   I  who have prided        myself on my discernment  I  who have valued myself on my        abilities  who have often disdained the generous candour of my        sister  and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust         How humiliating is this discovery  Yet  how just a humiliation         Had I been in love  I could not have been more wretchedly blind         But vanity  not love  has been my folly  Pleased with the        preference of one  and offended by the neglect of the other  on        the very beginning of our acquaintance  I have courted        prepossession and ignorance  and driven reason away  where either        were concerned  Till this moment I never knew myself            From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley  her thoughts were in a        line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr  Darcy s        explanation  there  had appeared very insufficient  and she read        it again  Widely different was the effect of a second perusal         How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance         which she had been obliged to give in the other  He declared        himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment         and she could not help remembering what Charlotte s opinion had        always been  Neither could she deny the justice of his        description of Jane  She felt that Jane s feelings  though        fervent  were little displayed  and that there was a constant        complacency in her air and manner not often united with great        sensibility           When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were        mentioned in terms of such mortifying  yet merited reproach  her        sense of shame was severe  The justice of the charge struck her        too forcibly for denial  and the circumstances to which he        particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball         and as confirming all his first disapprobation  could not have        made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers           The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt  It        soothed  but it could not console her for the contempt which had        thus been self attracted by the rest of her family  and as she        considered that Jane s disappointment had in fact been the work        of her nearest relations  and reflected how materially the credit        of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct  she felt        depressed beyond anything she had ever known before           After wandering along the lane for two hours  giving way to every        variety of thought re considering events  determining        probabilities  and reconciling herself  as well as she could  to        a change so sudden and so important  fatigue  and a recollection        of her long absence  made her at length return home  and she        entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual         and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make        her unfit for conversation           She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had        each called during her absence  Mr  Darcy  only for a few        minutes  to take leave but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been        sitting with them at least an hour  hoping for her return  and        almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found         Elizabeth could but just  affect  concern in missing him  she        really rejoiced at it  Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an        object  she could think only of her letter           Chapter 37          The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning  and Mr  Collins        having been in waiting near the lodges  to make them his parting        obeisance  was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence  of        their appearing in very good health  and in as tolerable spirits        as could be expected  after the melancholy scene so lately gone        through at Rosings  To Rosings he then hastened  to console Lady        Catherine and her daughter  and on his return brought back  with        great satisfaction  a message from her ladyship  importing that        she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having        them all to dine with her           Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that         had she chosen it  she might by this time have been presented to        her as her future niece  nor could she think  without a smile  of        what her ladyship s indignation would have been   What would she        have said  how would she have behaved   were questions with which        she amused herself           Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party   I        assure you  I feel it exceedingly   said Lady Catherine   I        believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do  But I        am particularly attached to these young men  and know them to be        so much attached to me  They were excessively sorry to go  But so        they always are  The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably        till just at last  but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely         more  I think  than last year  His attachment to Rosings        certainly increases            Mr  Collins had a compliment  and an allusion to throw in here         which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter           Lady Catherine observed  after dinner  that Miss Bennet seemed        out of spirits  and immediately accounting for it herself  by        supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon  she        added            But if that is the case  you must write to your mother and beg        that you may stay a little longer  Mrs  Collins will be very glad        of your company  I am sure             I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation          replied Elizabeth   but it is not in my power to accept it  I        must be in town next Saturday             Why  at that rate  you will have been here only six weeks  I        expected you to stay two months  I told Mrs  Collins so before        you came  There can be no occasion for your going so soon  Mrs         Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight             But my father cannot  He wrote last week to hurry my return             Oh  your father of course may spare you  if your mother can         Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father  And if        you will stay another  month  complete  it will be in my power to        take one of you as far as London  for I am going there early in        June  for a week  and as Dawson does not object to the        barouche box  there will be very good room for one of you and        indeed  if the weather should happen to be cool  I should not        object to taking you both  as you are neither of you large             You are all kindness  madam  but I believe we must abide by our        original plan            Lady Catherine seemed resigned   Mrs  Collins  you must send a        servant with them  You know I always speak my mind  and I cannot        bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves         It is highly improper  You must contrive to send somebody  I have        the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing  Young        women should always be properly guarded and attended  according        to their situation in life  When my niece Georgiana went to        Ramsgate last summer  I made a point of her having two        men servants go with her  Miss Darcy  the daughter of Mr  Darcy         of Pemberley  and Lady Anne  could not have appeared with        propriety in a different manner  I am excessively attentive to        all those things  You must send John with the young ladies  Mrs         Collins  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it  for it would        really be discreditable to  you  to let them go alone             My uncle is to send a servant for us             Oh  Your uncle  He keeps a man servant  does he  I am very glad        you have somebody who thinks of these things  Where shall you        change horses  Oh  Bromley  of course  If you mention my name at        the Bell  you will be attended to            Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their        journey  and as she did not answer them all herself  attention        was necessary  which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her  or         with a mind so occupied  she might have forgotten where she was         Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours  whenever she was        alone  she gave way to it as the greatest relief  and not a day        went by without a solitary walk  in which she might indulge in        all the delight of unpleasant recollections           Mr  Darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by        heart  She studied every sentence  and her feelings towards its        writer were at times widely different  When she remembered the        style of his address  she was still full of indignation  but when        she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him         her anger was turned against herself  and his disappointed        feelings became the object of compassion  His attachment excited        gratitude  his general character respect  but she could not        approve him  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal  or        feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again  In her own        past behaviour  there was a constant source of vexation and        regret  and in the unhappy defects of her family  a subject of        yet heavier chagrin  They were hopeless of remedy  Her father         contented with laughing at them  would never exert himself to        restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters  and her        mother  with manners so far from right herself  was entirely        insensible of the evil  Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane        in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia         but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence  what        chance could there be of improvement  Catherine  weak spirited         irritable  and completely under Lydia s guidance  had been always        affronted by their advice  and Lydia  self willed and careless         would scarcely give them a hearing  They were ignorant  idle  and        vain  While there was an officer in Meryton  they would flirt        with him  and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn  they        would be going there forever           Anxiety on Jane s behalf was another prevailing concern  and Mr         Darcy s explanation  by restoring Bingley to all her former good        opinion  heightened the sense of what Jane had lost  His        affection was proved to have been sincere  and his conduct        cleared of all blame  unless any could attach to the implicitness        of his confidence in his friend  How grievous then was the        thought that  of a situation so desirable in every respect  so        replete with advantage  so promising for happiness  Jane had been        deprived  by the folly and indecorum of her own family           When to these recollections was added the development of        Wickham s character  it may be easily believed that the happy        spirits which had seldom been depressed before  were now so much        affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear        tolerably cheerful           Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last        week of her stay as they had been at first  The very last evening        was spent there  and her ladyship again enquired minutely into        the particulars of their journey  gave them directions as to the        best method of packing  and was so urgent on the necessity of        placing gowns in the only right way  that Maria thought herself        obliged  on her return  to undo all the work of the morning  and        pack her trunk afresh           When they parted  Lady Catherine  with great condescension         wished them a good journey  and invited them to come to Hunsford        again next year  and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to        curtsey and hold out her hand to both           Chapter 38          On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr  Collins met for breakfast a        few minutes before the others appeared  and he took the        opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed        indispensably necessary            I know not  Miss Elizabeth   said he   whether Mrs  Collins has        yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us  but I        am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving        her thanks for it  The favour of your company has been much felt         I assure you  We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our        humble abode  Our plain manner of living  our small rooms and few        domestics  and the little we see of the world  must make Hunsford        extremely dull to a young lady like yourself  but I hope you will        believe us grateful for the condescension  and that we have done        everything in our power to prevent your spending your time        unpleasantly            Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness         She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment  and the pleasure of        being with Charlotte  and the kind attentions she had received         must make  her  feel the obliged  Mr  Collins was gratified  and        with a more smiling solemnity replied            It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your        time not disagreeably  We have certainly done our best  and most        fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very        superior society  and  from our connection with Rosings  the        frequent means of varying the humble home scene  I think we may        flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been        entirely irksome  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine s        family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing        which few can boast  You see on what a footing we are  You see        how continually we are engaged there  In truth I must acknowledge        that  with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage  I        should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion         while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings            Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings  and he        was obliged to walk about the room  while Elizabeth tried to        unite civility and truth in a few short sentences            You may  in fact  carry a very favourable report of us into        Hertfordshire  my dear cousin  I flatter myself at least that you        will be able to do so  Lady Catherine s great attentions to Mrs         Collins you have been a daily witness of  and altogether I trust        it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but        on this point it will be as well to be silent  Only let me assure        you  my dear Miss Elizabeth  that I can from my heart most        cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage  My dear Charlotte        and I have but one mind and one way of thinking  There is in        everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas        between us  We seem to have been designed for each other            Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where        that was the case  and with equal sincerity could add  that she        firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts  She was        not sorry  however  to have the recital of them interrupted by        the lady from whom they sprang  Poor Charlotte  it was melancholy        to leave her to such society  But she had chosen it with her eyes        open  and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to        go  she did not seem to ask for compassion  Her home and her        housekeeping  her parish and her poultry  and all their dependent        concerns  had not yet lost their charms           At length the chaise arrived  the trunks were fastened on  the        parcels placed within  and it was pronounced to be ready  After        an affectionate parting between the friends  Elizabeth was        attended to the carriage by Mr  Collins  and as they walked down        the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all        her family  not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had        received at Longbourn in the winter  and his compliments to Mr         and Mrs  Gardiner  though unknown  He then handed her in  Maria        followed  and the door was on the point of being closed  when he        suddenly reminded them  with some consternation  that they had        hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at        Rosings            But   he added   you will of course wish to have your humble        respects delivered to them  with your grateful thanks for their        kindness to you while you have been here            Elizabeth made no objection  the door was then allowed to be        shut  and the carriage drove off            Good gracious   cried Maria  after a few minutes  silence   it        seems but a day or two since we first came  and yet how many        things have happened             A great many indeed   said her companion with a sigh            We have dined nine times at Rosings  besides drinking tea there        twice  How much I shall have to tell            Elizabeth added privately   And how much I shall have to        conceal            Their journey was performed without much conversation  or any        alarm  and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they        reached Mr  Gardiner s house  where they were to remain a few        days           Jane looked well  and Elizabeth had little opportunity of        studying her spirits  amidst the various engagements which the        kindness of her aunt had reserved for them  But Jane was to go        home with her  and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for        observation           It was not without an effort  meanwhile  that she could wait even        for Longbourn  before she told her sister of Mr  Darcy s        proposals  To know that she had the power of revealing what would        so exceedingly astonish Jane  and must  at the same time  so        highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been        able to reason away  was such a temptation to openness as nothing        could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she        remained as to the extent of what she should communicate  and her        fear  if she once entered on the subject  of being hurried into        repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister        further           Chapter 39          It was the second week in May  in which the three young ladies        set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of     in        Hertfordshire  and  as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr         Bennet s carriage was to meet them  they quickly perceived  in        token of the coachman s punctuality  both Kitty and Lydia looking        out of a dining room up stairs  These two girls had been above an        hour in the place  happily employed in visiting an opposite        milliner  watching the sentinel on guard  and dressing a salad        and cucumber           After welcoming their sisters  they triumphantly displayed a        table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually        affords  exclaiming   Is not this nice  Is not this an agreeable        surprise             And we mean to treat you all   added Lydia   but you must lend        us the money  for we have just spent ours at the shop out there          Then  showing her purchases  Look here  I have bought this        bonnet  I do not think it is very pretty  but I thought I might        as well buy it as not  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get        home  and see if I can make it up any better            And when her sisters abused it as ugly  she added  with perfect        unconcern   Oh  but there were two or three much uglier in the        shop  and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim        it with fresh  I think it will be very tolerable  Besides  it        will not much signify what one wears this summer  after the          shire have left Meryton  and they are going in a fortnight             Are they indeed   cried Elizabeth  with the greatest        satisfaction            They are going to be encamped near Brighton  and I do so want        papa to take us all there for the summer  It would be such a        delicious scheme  and I dare say would hardly cost anything at        all  Mamma would like to go too of all things  Only think what a        miserable summer else we shall have             Yes   thought Elizabeth    that  would be a delightful scheme        indeed  and completely do for us at once  Good Heaven  Brighton         and a whole campful of soldiers  to us  who have been overset        already by one poor regiment of militia  and the monthly balls of        Meryton             Now I have got some news for you   said Lydia  as they sat down        at table   What do you think  It is excellent news capital        news and about a certain person we all like            Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other  and the waiter was told        he need not stay  Lydia laughed  and said            Aye  that is just like your formality and discretion  You        thought the waiter must not hear  as if he cared  I dare say he        often hears worse things said than I am going to say  But he is        an ugly fellow  I am glad he is gone  I never saw such a long        chin in my life  Well  but now for my news  it is about dear        Wickham  too good for the waiter  is it not  There is no danger        of Wickham s marrying Mary King  There s for you  She is gone        down to her uncle at Liverpool  gone to stay  Wickham is safe             And Mary King is safe   added Elizabeth   safe from a connection        imprudent as to fortune             She is a great fool for going away  if she liked him             But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side   said        Jane            I am sure there is not on  his   I will answer for it  he never        cared three straws about her who  could  about such a nasty        little freckled thing            Elizabeth was shocked to think that  however incapable of such        coarseness of  expression  herself  the coarseness of the         sentiment  was little other than her own breast had harboured        and fancied liberal           As soon as all had ate  and the elder ones paid  the carriage was        ordered  and after some contrivance  the whole party  with all        their boxes  work bags  and parcels  and the unwelcome addition        of Kitty s and Lydia s purchases  were seated in it            How nicely we are all crammed in   cried Lydia   I am glad I        bought my bonnet  if it is only for the fun of having another        bandbox  Well  now let us be quite comfortable and snug  and talk        and laugh all the way home  And in the first place  let us hear        what has happened to you all since you went away  Have you seen        any pleasant men  Have you had any flirting  I was in great hopes        that one of you would have got a husband before you came back         Jane will be quite an old maid soon  I declare  She is almost        three and twenty  Lord  how ashamed I should be of not being        married before three and twenty  My aunt Phillips wants you so to        get husbands  you can t think  She says Lizzy had better have        taken Mr  Collins  but  I  do not think there would have been any        fun in it  Lord  how I should like to be married before any of        you  and then I would  chaperon  you about to all the balls  Dear        me  we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel        Forster s  Kitty and me were to spend the day there  and Mrs         Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening   by the        bye  Mrs  Forster and me are  such  friends   and so she asked        the two Harringtons to come  but Harriet was ill  and so Pen was        forced to come by herself  and then  what do you think we did  We        dressed up Chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for        a lady  only think what fun  Not a soul knew of it  but Colonel        and Mrs  Forster  and Kitty and me  except my aunt  for we were        forced to borrow one of her gowns  and you cannot imagine how        well he looked  When Denny  and Wickham  and Pratt  and two or        three more of the men came in  they did not know him in the        least  Lord  how I laughed  and so did Mrs  Forster  I thought I        should have died  And  that  made the men suspect something  and        then they soon found out what was the matter            With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes  did        Lydia  assisted by Kitty s hints and additions  endeavour to        amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn  Elizabeth listened        as little as she could  but there was no escaping the frequent        mention of Wickham s name           Their reception at home was most kind  Mrs  Bennet rejoiced to        see Jane in undiminished beauty  and more than once during dinner        did Mr  Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth            I am glad you are come back  Lizzy            Their party in the dining room was large  for almost all the        Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news  and various were        the subjects that occupied them  Lady Lucas was enquiring of        Maria  after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter  Mrs         Bennet was doubly engaged  on one hand collecting an account of        the present fashions from Jane  who sat some way below her  and         on the other  retailing them all to the younger Lucases  and        Lydia  in a voice rather louder than any other person s  was        enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who        would hear her            Oh  Mary   said she   I wish you had gone with us  for we had        such fun  As we went along  Kitty and I drew up the blinds  and        pretended there was nobody in the coach  and I should have gone        so all the way  if Kitty had not been sick  and when we got to        the George  I do think we behaved very handsomely  for we treated        the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world  and        if you would have gone  we would have treated you too  And then        when we came away it was such fun  I thought we never should have        got into the coach  I was ready to die of laughter  And then we        were so merry all the way home  we talked and laughed so loud         that anybody might have heard us ten miles off            To this Mary very gravely replied   Far be it from me  my dear        sister  to depreciate such pleasures  They would doubtless be        congenial with the generality of female minds  But I confess they        would have no charms for  me  I should infinitely prefer a book            But of this answer Lydia heard not a word  She seldom listened to        anybody for more than half a minute  and never attended to Mary        at all           In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to        walk to Meryton  and to see how everybody went on  but Elizabeth        steadily opposed the scheme  It should not be said that the Miss        Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in        pursuit of the officers  There was another reason too for her        opposition  She dreaded seeing Mr  Wickham again  and was        resolved to avoid it as long as possible  The comfort to  her  of        the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression         In a fortnight they were to go and once gone  she hoped there        could be nothing more to plague her on his account           She had not been many hours at home before she found that the        Brighton scheme  of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn         was under frequent discussion between her parents  Elizabeth saw        directly that her father had not the smallest intention of        yielding  but his answers were at the same time so vague and        equivocal  that her mother  though often disheartened  had never        yet despaired of succeeding at last           Chapter 40          Elizabeth s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened        could no longer be overcome  and at length  resolving to suppress        every particular in which her sister was concerned  and preparing        her to be surprised  she related to her the next morning the        chief of the scene between Mr  Darcy and herself           Miss Bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong        sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear        perfectly natural  and all surprise was shortly lost in other        feelings  She was sorry that Mr  Darcy should have delivered his        sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them  but        still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s        refusal must have given him            His being so sure of succeeding was wrong   said she   and        certainly ought not to have appeared  but consider how much it        must increase his disappointment             Indeed   replied Elizabeth   I am heartily sorry for him  but he        has other feelings  which will probably soon drive away his        regard for me  You do not blame me  however  for refusing him             Blame you  Oh  no             But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham             No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did             But you  will  know it  when I tell you what happened the very        next day            She then spoke of the letter  repeating the whole of its contents        as far as they concerned George Wickham  What a stroke was this        for poor Jane  who would willingly have gone through the world        without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole        race of mankind  as was here collected in one individual  Nor was        Darcy s vindication  though grateful to her feelings  capable of        consoling her for such discovery  Most earnestly did she labour        to prove the probability of error  and seek to clear the one        without involving the other            This will not do   said Elizabeth   you never will be able to        make both of them good for anything  Take your choice  but you        must be satisfied with only one  There is but such a quantity of        merit between them  just enough to make one good sort of man  and        of late it has been shifting about pretty much  For my part  I am        inclined to believe it all Darcy s  but you shall do as you        choose            It was some time  however  before a smile could be extorted from        Jane            I do not know when I have been more shocked   said she   Wickham        so very bad  It is almost past belief  And poor Mr  Darcy  Dear        Lizzy  only consider what he must have suffered  Such a        disappointment  and with the knowledge of your ill opinion  too         and having to relate such a thing of his sister  It is really too        distressing  I am sure you must feel it so             Oh  no  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you        so full of both  I know you will do him such ample justice  that        I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent  Your        profusion makes me saving  and if you lament over him much        longer  my heart will be as light as a feather             Poor Wickham  there is such an expression of goodness in his        countenance  such an openness and gentleness in his manner             There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of        those two young men  One has got all the goodness  and the other        all the appearance of it             I never thought Mr  Darcy so deficient in the  appearance  of it        as you used to do             And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a        dislike to him  without any reason  It is such a spur to one s        genius  such an opening for wit  to have a dislike of that kind         One may be continually abusive without saying anything just  but        one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then        stumbling on something witty             Lizzy  when you first read that letter  I am sure you could not        treat the matter as you do now             Indeed  I could not  I was uncomfortable enough  I may say        unhappy  And with no one to speak to about what I felt  no Jane        to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain        and nonsensical as I knew I had  Oh  how I wanted you             How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong        expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr  Darcy  for now they         do  appear wholly undeserved             Certainly  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a        most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been        encouraging  There is one point on which I want your advice  I        want to be told whether I ought  or ought not  to make our        acquaintances in general understand Wickham s character            Miss Bennet paused a little  and then replied   Surely there can        be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully  What is your        opinion             That it ought not to be attempted  Mr  Darcy has not authorised        me to make his communication public  On the contrary  every        particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as        possible to myself  and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to        the rest of his conduct  who will believe me  The general        prejudice against Mr  Darcy is so violent  that it would be the        death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him        in an amiable light  I am not equal to it  Wickham will soon be        gone  and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he        really is  Some time hence it will be all found out  and then we        may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before  At present        I will say nothing about it             You are quite right  To have his errors made public might ruin        him for ever  He is now  perhaps  sorry for what he has done  and        anxious to re establish a character  We must not make him        desperate            The tumult of Elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation         She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her        for a fortnight  and was certain of a willing listener in Jane         whenever she might wish to talk again of either  But there was        still something lurking behind  of which prudence forbade the        disclosure  She dared not relate the other half of Mr  Darcy s        letter  nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been        valued by her friend  Here was knowledge in which no one could        partake  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect        understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing        off this last encumbrance of mystery   And then   said she   if        that very improbable event should ever take place  I shall merely        be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable        manner himself  The liberty of communication cannot be mine till        it has lost all its value            She was now  on being settled at home  at leisure to observe the        real state of her sister s spirits  Jane was not happy  She still        cherished a very tender affection for Bingley  Having never even        fancied herself in love before  her regard had all the warmth of        first attachment  and  from her age and disposition  greater        steadiness than most first attachments often boast  and so        fervently did she value his remembrance  and prefer him to every        other man  that all her good sense  and all her attention to the        feelings of her friends  were requisite to check the indulgence        of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health        and their tranquillity            Well  Lizzy   said Mrs  Bennet one day   what is your opinion         now  of this sad business of Jane s  For my part  I am        determined never to speak of it again to anybody  I told my        sister Phillips so the other day  But I cannot find out that Jane        saw anything of him in London  Well  he is a very undeserving        young man and I do not suppose there s the least chance in the        world of her ever getting him now  There is no talk of his coming        to Netherfield again in the summer  and I have enquired of        everybody  too  who is likely to know             I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more             Oh well  it is just as he chooses  Nobody wants him to come         Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill  and        if I was her  I would not have put up with it  Well  my comfort        is  I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart  and then he will        be sorry for what he has done            But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such        expectation  she made no answer            Well  Lizzy   continued her mother  soon afterwards   and so the        Collinses live very comfortable  do they  Well  well  I only hope        it will last  And what sort of table do they keep  Charlotte is        an excellent manager  I dare say  If she is half as sharp as her        mother  she is saving enough  There is nothing extravagant in         their  housekeeping  I dare say             No  nothing at all             A great deal of good management  depend upon it  Yes  yes          They  will take care not to outrun their income   They  will        never be distressed for money  Well  much good may it do them         And so  I suppose  they often talk of having Longbourn when your        father is dead  They look upon it as quite their own  I dare say         whenever that happens             It was a subject which they could not mention before me             No  it would have been strange if they had  but I make no doubt        they often talk of it between themselves  Well  if they can be        easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own  so much the        better   I  should be ashamed of having one that was only        entailed on me            Chapter 41          The first week of their return was soon gone  The second began         It was the last of the regiment s stay in Meryton  and all the        young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace  The        dejection was almost universal  The elder Miss Bennets alone were        still able to eat  drink  and sleep  and pursue the usual course        of their employments  Very frequently were they reproached for        this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia  whose own misery was        extreme  and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in        any of the family            Good Heaven  what is to become of us  What are we to do   would        they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe   How can you be        smiling so  Lizzy            Their affectionate mother shared all their grief  she remembered        what she had herself endured on a similar occasion         five and twenty years ago            I am sure   said she   I cried for two days together when        Colonel Miller s regiment went away  I thought I should have        broken my heart             I am sure I shall break  mine    said Lydia            If one could but go to Brighton   observed Mrs  Bennet            Oh  yes  if one could but go to Brighton  But papa is so        disagreeable             A little sea bathing would set me up forever             And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do  me  a great deal of        good   added Kitty           Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through        Longbourn House  Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them  but all        sense of pleasure was lost in shame  She felt anew the justice of        Mr  Darcy s objections  and never had she been so much disposed        to pardon his interference in the views of his friend           But the gloom of Lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away  for        she received an invitation from Mrs  Forster  the wife of the        colonel of the regiment  to accompany her to Brighton  This        invaluable friend was a very young woman  and very lately        married  A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had        recommended her and Lydia to each other  and out of their  three         months  acquaintance they had been intimate  two            The rapture of Lydia on this occasion  her adoration of Mrs         Forster  the delight of Mrs  Bennet  and the mortification of        Kitty  are scarcely to be described  Wholly inattentive to her        sister s feelings  Lydia flew about the house in restless        ecstasy  calling for everyone s congratulations  and laughing and        talking with more violence than ever  whilst the luckless Kitty        continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as        unreasonable as her accent was peevish            I cannot see why Mrs  Forster should not ask  me  as well as        Lydia   said she   Though I am  not  her particular friend  I        have just as much right to be asked as she has  and more too  for        I am two years older            In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable  and Jane to        make her resigned  As for Elizabeth herself  this invitation was        so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother        and Lydia  that she considered it as the death warrant of all        possibility of common sense for the latter  and detestable as        such a step must make her were it known  she could not help        secretly advising her father not to let her go  She represented        to him all the improprieties of Lydia s general behaviour  the        little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a        woman as Mrs  Forster  and the probability of her being yet more        imprudent with such a companion at Brighton  where the        temptations must be greater than at home  He heard her        attentively  and then said            Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some        public place or other  and we can never expect her to do it with        so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the        present circumstances             If you were aware   said Elizabeth   of the very great        disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of        Lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay  which has already        arisen from it  I am sure you would judge differently in the        affair             Already arisen   repeated Mr  Bennet   What  has she frightened        away some of your lovers  Poor little Lizzy  But do not be cast        down  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a        little absurdity are not worth a regret  Come  let me see the        list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia s        folly             Indeed you are mistaken  I have no such injuries to resent  It        is not of particular  but of general evils  which I am now        complaining  Our importance  our respectability in the world must        be affected by the wild volatility  the assurance and disdain of        all restraint which mark Lydia s character  Excuse me  for I must        speak plainly  If you  my dear father  will not take the trouble        of checking her exuberant spirits  and of teaching her that her        present pursuits are not to be the business of her life  she will        soon be beyond the reach of amendment  Her character will be        fixed  and she will  at sixteen  be the most determined flirt        that ever made herself or her family ridiculous  a flirt  too  in        the worst and meanest degree of flirtation  without any        attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person  and  from the        ignorance and emptiness of her mind  wholly unable to ward off        any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for        admiration will excite  In this danger Kitty also is        comprehended  She will follow wherever Lydia leads  Vain         ignorant  idle  and absolutely uncontrolled  Oh  my dear father         can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and        despised wherever they are known  and that their sisters will not        be often involved in the disgrace            Mr  Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject  and        affectionately taking her hand said in reply            Do not make yourself uneasy  my love  Wherever you and Jane are        known you must be respected and valued  and you will not appear        to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say  three very        silly sisters  We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does        not go to Brighton  Let her go  then  Colonel Forster is a        sensible man  and will keep her out of any real mischief  and she        is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody  At        Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt        than she has been here  The officers will find women better worth        their notice  Let us hope  therefore  that her being there may        teach her her own insignificance  At any rate  she cannot grow        many degrees worse  without authorising us to lock her up for the        rest of her life            With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content  but her own        opinion continued the same  and she left him disappointed and        sorry  It was not in her nature  however  to increase her        vexations by dwelling on them  She was confident of having        performed her duty  and to fret over unavoidable evils  or        augment them by anxiety  was no part of her disposition           Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference        with her father  their indignation would hardly have found        expression in their united volubility  In Lydia s imagination  a        visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly        happiness  She saw  with the creative eye of fancy  the streets        of that gay bathing place covered with officers  She saw herself        the object of attention  to tens and to scores of them at present        unknown  She saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched        forth in beauteous uniformity of lines  crowded with the young        and the gay  and dazzling with scarlet  and  to complete the        view  she saw herself seated beneath a tent  tenderly flirting        with at least six officers at once           Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects        and such realities as these  what would have been her sensations         They could have been understood only by her mother  who might        have felt nearly the same  Lydia s going to Brighton was all that        consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband s never        intending to go there himself           But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed  and their        raptures continued  with little intermission  to the very day of        Lydia s leaving home           Elizabeth was now to see Mr  Wickham for the last time  Having        been frequently in company with him since her return  agitation        was pretty well over  the agitations of former partiality        entirely so  She had even learnt to detect  in the very        gentleness which had first delighted her  an affectation and a        sameness to disgust and weary  In his present behaviour to        herself  moreover  she had a fresh source of displeasure  for the        inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which        had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve         after what had since passed  to provoke her  She lost all concern        for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such        idle and frivolous gallantry  and while she steadily repressed        it  could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing         that however long  and for whatever cause  his attentions had        been withdrawn  her vanity would be gratified  and her preference        secured at any time by their renewal           On the very last day of the regiment s remaining at Meryton  he        dined  with others of the officers  at Longbourn  and so little        was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour  that on        his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had        passed at Hunsford  she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam s and Mr         Darcy s having both spent three weeks at Rosings  and asked him         if he was acquainted with the former           He looked surprised  displeased  alarmed  but with a moment s        recollection and a returning smile  replied  that he had formerly        seen him often  and  after observing that he was a very        gentlemanlike man  asked her how she had liked him  Her answer        was warmly in his favour  With an air of indifference he soon        afterwards added            How long did you say he was at Rosings             Nearly three weeks             And you saw him frequently             Yes  almost every day             His manners are very different from his cousin s             Yes  very different  But I think Mr  Darcy improves upon        acquaintance             Indeed   cried Mr  Wickham with a look which did not escape her          And pray  may I ask    But checking himself  he added  in a        gayer tone   Is it in address that he improves  Has he deigned to        add aught of civility to his ordinary style  for I dare not        hope   he continued in a lower and more serious tone   that he is        improved in essentials             Oh  no   said Elizabeth   In essentials  I believe  he is very        much what he ever was            While she spoke  Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to        rejoice over her words  or to distrust their meaning  There was a        something in her countenance which made him listen with an        apprehensive and anxious attention  while she added            When I said that he improved on acquaintance  I did not mean        that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement  but        that  from knowing him better  his disposition was better        understood            Wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and        agitated look  for a few minutes he was silent  till  shaking off        his embarrassment  he turned to her again  and said in the        gentlest of accents            You  who so well know my feeling towards Mr  Darcy  will readily        comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to        assume even the  appearance  of what is right  His pride  in that        direction  may be of service  if not to himself  to many others         for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have        suffered by  I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which        you  I imagine  have been alluding  is merely adopted on his        visits to his aunt  of whose good opinion and judgement he stands        much in awe  His fear of her has always operated  I know  when        they were together  and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish        of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh  which I am certain        he has very much at heart            Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this  but she answered        only by a slight inclination of the head  She saw that he wanted        to engage her on the old subject of his grievances  and she was        in no humour to indulge him  The rest of the evening passed with        the  appearance   on his side  of usual cheerfulness  but with no        further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth  and they parted at last        with mutual civility  and possibly a mutual desire of never        meeting again           When the party broke up  Lydia returned with Mrs  Forster to        Meryton  from whence they were to set out early the next morning         The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than        pathetic  Kitty was the only one who shed tears  but she did weep        from vexation and envy  Mrs  Bennet was diffuse in her good        wishes for the felicity of her daughter  and impressive in her        injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying        herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason        to believe would be well attended to  and in the clamorous        happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell  the more gentle        adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard           Chapter 42          Had Elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family  she        could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal        felicity or domestic comfort  Her father  captivated by youth and        beauty  and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty        generally give  had married a woman whose weak understanding and        illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all        real affection for her  Respect  esteem  and confidence had        vanished for ever  and all his views of domestic happiness were        overthrown  But Mr  Bennet was not of a disposition to seek        comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had        brought on  in any of those pleasures which too often console the        unfortunate for their folly or their vice  He was fond of the        country and of books  and from these tastes had arisen his        principal enjoyments  To his wife he was very little otherwise        indebted  than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his        amusement  This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in        general wish to owe to his wife  but where other powers of        entertainment are wanting  the true philosopher will derive        benefit from such as are given           Elizabeth  however  had never been blind to the impropriety of        her father s behaviour as a husband  She had always seen it with        pain  but respecting his abilities  and grateful for his        affectionate treatment of herself  she endeavoured to forget what        she could not overlook  and to banish from her thoughts that        continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which  in        exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children  was so        highly reprehensible  But she had never felt so strongly as now        the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable        a marriage  nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising        from so ill judged a direction of talents  talents  which         rightly used  might at least have preserved the respectability of        his daughters  even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his        wife           When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham s departure she found        little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment         Their parties abroad were less varied than before  and at home        she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the        dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their        domestic circle  and  though Kitty might in time regain her        natural degree of sense  since the disturbers of her brain were        removed  her other sister  from whose disposition greater evil        might be apprehended  was likely to be hardened in all her folly        and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a        watering place and a camp  Upon the whole  therefore  she found         what has been sometimes found before  that an event to which she        had looked forward with impatient desire did not  in taking        place  bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself  It        was consequently necessary to name some other period for the        commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which        her wishes and hopes might be fixed  and by again enjoying the        pleasure of anticipation  console herself for the present  and        prepare for another disappointment  Her tour to the Lakes was now        the object of her happiest thoughts  it was her best consolation        for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her        mother and Kitty made inevitable  and could she have included        Jane in the scheme  every part of it would have been perfect            But it is fortunate   thought she   that I have something to        wish for  Were the whole arrangement complete  my disappointment        would be certain  But here  by carrying with me one ceaseless        source of regret in my sister s absence  I may reasonably hope to        have all my expectations of pleasure realised  A scheme of which        every part promises delight can never be successful  and general        disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little        peculiar vexation            When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very        minutely to her mother and Kitty  but her letters were always        long expected  and always very short  Those to her mother        contained little else than that they were just returned from the        library  where such and such officers had attended them  and        where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite        wild  that she had a new gown  or a new parasol  which she would        have described more fully  but was obliged to leave off in a        violent hurry  as Mrs  Forster called her  and they were going        off to the camp  and from her correspondence with her sister         there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty         though rather longer  were much too full of lines under the words        to be made public           After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence  health         good humour  and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn         Everything wore a happier aspect  The families who had been in        town for the winter came back again  and summer finery and summer        engagements arose  Mrs  Bennet was restored to her usual        querulous serenity  and  by the middle of June  Kitty was so much        recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears  an event        of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the        following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not        to mention an officer above once a day  unless  by some cruel and        malicious arrangement at the War Office  another regiment should        be quartered in Meryton           The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now        fast approaching  and a fortnight only was wanting of it  when a        letter arrived from Mrs  Gardiner  which at once delayed its        commencement and curtailed its extent  Mr  Gardiner would be        prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in        July  and must be in London again within a month  and as that        left too short a period for them to go so far  and see so much as        they had proposed  or at least to see it with the leisure and        comfort they had built on  they were obliged to give up the        Lakes  and substitute a more contracted tour  and  according to        the present plan  were to go no farther northwards than        Derbyshire  In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy        the chief of their three weeks  and to Mrs  Gardiner it had a        peculiarly strong attraction  The town where she had formerly        passed some years of her life  and where they were now to spend a        few days  was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all        the celebrated beauties of Matlock  Chatsworth  Dovedale  or the        Peak           Elizabeth was excessively disappointed  she had set her heart on        seeing the Lakes  and still thought there might have been time        enough  But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her        temper to be happy  and all was soon right again           With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected         It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of        Pemberley and its owner   But surely   said she   I may enter his        county with impunity  and rob it of a few petrified spars without        his perceiving me            The period of expectation was now doubled  Four weeks were to        pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival  But they did pass        away  and Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner  with their four children  did at        length appear at Longbourn  The children  two girls of six and        eight years old  and two younger boys  were to be left under the        particular care of their cousin Jane  who was the general        favourite  and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly        adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them         playing with them  and loving them           The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn  and set off the        next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement         One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness of companions  a        suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear        inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and        affection and intelligence  which might supply it among        themselves if there were disappointments abroad           It is not the object of this work to give a description of        Derbyshire  nor of any of the remarkable places through which        their route thither lay  Oxford  Blenheim  Warwick  Kenilworth         Birmingham  etc  are sufficiently known  A small part of        Derbyshire is all the present concern  To the little town of        Lambton  the scene of Mrs  Gardiner s former residence  and where        she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained  they        bent their steps  after having seen all the principal wonders of        the country  and within five miles of Lambton  Elizabeth found        from her aunt that Pemberley was situated  It was not in their        direct road  nor more than a mile or two out of it  In talking        over their route the evening before  Mrs  Gardiner expressed an        inclination to see the place again  Mr  Gardiner declared his        willingness  and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation            My love  should not you like to see a place of which you have        heard so much   said her aunt   a place  too  with which so many        of your acquaintances are connected  Wickham passed all his youth        there  you know            Elizabeth was distressed  She felt that she had no business at        Pemberley  and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing        it  She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses  after        going over so many  she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or        satin curtains           Mrs  Gardiner abused her stupidity   If it were merely a fine        house richly furnished   said she   I should not care about it        myself  but the grounds are delightful  They have some of the        finest woods in the country            Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce  The        possibility of meeting Mr  Darcy  while viewing the place         instantly occurred  It would be dreadful  She blushed at the very        idea  and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt        than to run such a risk  But against this there were objections         and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource  if        her private enquiries to the absence of the family were        unfavourably answered           Accordingly  when she retired at night  she asked the chambermaid        whether Pemberley were not a very fine place  what was the name        of its proprietor  and  with no little alarm  whether the family        were down for the summer  A most welcome negative followed the        last question and her alarms now being removed  she was at        leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house        herself  and when the subject was revived the next morning  and        she was again applied to  could readily answer  and with a proper        air of indifference  that she had not really any dislike to the        scheme  To Pemberley  therefore  they were to go           Chapter 43          Elizabeth  as they drove along  watched for the first appearance        of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation  and when at length        they turned in at the lodge  her spirits were in a high flutter           The park was very large  and contained great variety of ground         They entered it in one of its lowest points  and drove for some        time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent           Elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation  but she saw and        admired every remarkable spot and point of view  They gradually        ascended for half a mile  and then found themselves at the top of        a considerable eminence  where the wood ceased  and the eye was        instantly caught by Pemberley House  situated on the opposite        side of a valley  into which the road with some abruptness wound         It was a large  handsome stone building  standing well on rising        ground  and backed by a ridge of high woody hills  and in front         a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater  but        without any artificial appearance  Its banks were neither formal        nor falsely adorned  Elizabeth was delighted  She had never seen        a place for which nature had done more  or where natural beauty        had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste  They were        all of them warm in their admiration  and at that moment she felt        that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something           They descended the hill  crossed the bridge  and drove to the        door  and  while examining the nearer aspect of the house  all        her apprehension of meeting its owner returned  She dreaded lest        the chambermaid had been mistaken  On applying to see the place         they were admitted into the hall  and Elizabeth  as they waited        for the housekeeper  had leisure to wonder at her being where she        was           The housekeeper came  a respectable looking elderly woman  much        less fine  and more civil  than she had any notion of finding        her  They followed her into the dining parlour  It was a large         well proportioned room  handsomely fitted up  Elizabeth  after        slightly surveying it  went to a window to enjoy its prospect         The hill  crowned with wood  which they had descended  receiving        increased abruptness from the distance  was a beautiful object         Every disposition of the ground was good  and she looked on the        whole scene  the river  the trees scattered on its banks and the        winding of the valley  as far as she could trace it  with        delight  As they passed into other rooms these objects were        taking different positions  but from every window there were        beauties to be seen  The rooms were lofty and handsome  and their        furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor  but        Elizabeth saw  with admiration of his taste  that it was neither        gaudy nor uselessly fine  with less of splendour  and more real        elegance  than the furniture of Rosings            And of this place   thought she   I might have been mistress         With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted         Instead of viewing them as a stranger  I might have rejoiced in        them as my own  and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and        aunt  But no   recollecting herself  that could never be  my        uncle and aunt would have been lost to me  I should not have been        allowed to invite them            This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something very        like regret           She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was        really absent  but had not the courage for it  At length however         the question was asked by her uncle  and she turned away with        alarm  while Mrs  Reynolds replied that he was  adding   But we        expect him to morrow  with a large party of friends   How        rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any        circumstance been delayed a day           Her aunt now called her to look at a picture  She approached and        saw the likeness of Mr  Wickham  suspended  amongst several other        miniatures  over the mantelpiece  Her aunt asked her  smilingly         how she liked it  The housekeeper came forward  and told them it        was a picture of a young gentleman  the son of her late master s        steward  who had been brought up by him at his own expense   He        is now gone into the army   she added   but I am afraid he has        turned out very wild            Mrs  Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile  but Elizabeth        could not return it            And that   said Mrs  Reynolds  pointing to another of the        miniatures   is my master and very like him  It was drawn at the        same time as the other about eight years ago             I have heard much of your master s fine person   said Mrs         Gardiner  looking at the picture   it is a handsome face  But         Lizzy  you can tell us whether it is like or not            Mrs  Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this        intimation of her knowing her master            Does that young lady know Mr  Darcy            Elizabeth coloured  and said   A little             And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman  ma am             Yes  very handsome             I am sure  I  know none so handsome  but in the gallery up        stairs you will see a finer  larger picture of him than this         This room was my late master s favourite room  and these        miniatures are just as they used to be then  He was very fond of        them            This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr  Wickham s being among them           Mrs  Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy         drawn when she was only eight years old            And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother   said Mrs         Gardiner            Oh  yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen  and so        accomplished  She plays and sings all day long  In the next room        is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my        master  she comes here to morrow with him            Mr  Gardiner  whose manners were very easy and pleasant         encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks         Mrs  Reynolds  either by pride or attachment  had evidently great        pleasure in talking of her master and his sister            Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year             Not so much as I could wish  sir  but I dare say he may spend        half his time here  and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer        months             Except   thought Elizabeth   when she goes to Ramsgate             If your master would marry  you might see more of him             Yes  sir  but I do not know when  that  will be  I do not know        who is good enough for him            Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner smiled  Elizabeth could not help saying          It is very much to his credit  I am sure  that you should think        so             I say no more than the truth  and everybody will say that knows        him   replied the other  Elizabeth thought this was going pretty        far  and she listened with increasing astonishment as the        housekeeper added   I have never known a cross word from him in        my life  and I have known him ever since he was four years old            This was praise  of all others most extraordinary  most opposite        to her ideas  That he was not a good tempered man had been her        firmest opinion  Her keenest attention was awakened  she longed        to hear more  and was grateful to her uncle for saying            There are very few people of whom so much can be said  You are        lucky in having such a master             Yes  sir  I know I am  If I were to go through the world  I        could not meet with a better  But I have always observed  that        they who are good natured when children  are good natured when        they grow up  and he was always the sweetest tempered  most        generous hearted boy in the world            Elizabeth almost stared at her   Can this be Mr  Darcy   thought        she            His father was an excellent man   said Mrs  Gardiner            Yes  ma am  that he was indeed  and his son will be just like        him just as affable to the poor            Elizabeth listened  wondered  doubted  and was impatient for        more  Mrs  Reynolds could interest her on no other point  She        related the subjects of the pictures  the dimensions of the        rooms  and the price of the furniture  in vain  Mr  Gardiner         highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he        attributed her excessive commendation of her master  soon led        again to the subject  and she dwelt with energy on his many        merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase            He is the best landlord  and the best master   said she   that        ever lived  not like the wild young men nowadays  who think of        nothing but themselves  There is not one of his tenants or        servants but will give him a good name  Some people call him        proud  but I am sure I never saw anything of it  To my fancy  it        is only because he does not rattle away like other young men             In what an amiable light does this place him   thought        Elizabeth            This fine account of him   whispered her aunt as they walked          is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend             Perhaps we might be deceived             That is not very likely  our authority was too good            On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very        pretty sitting room  lately fitted up with greater elegance and        lightness than the apartments below  and were informed that it        was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy  who had taken a        liking to the room when last at Pemberley            He is certainly a good brother   said Elizabeth  as she walked        towards one of the windows           Mrs  Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy s delight  when she should        enter the room   And this is always the way with him   she added          Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in        a moment  There is nothing he would not do for her            The picture gallery  and two or three of the principal bedrooms         were all that remained to be shown  In the former were many good        paintings  but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art  and from such        as had been already visible below  she had willingly turned to        look at some drawings of Miss Darcy s  in crayons  whose subjects        were usually more interesting  and also more intelligible           In the gallery there were many family portraits  but they could        have little to fix the attention of a stranger  Elizabeth walked        in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her         At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance to        Mr  Darcy  with such a smile over the face as she remembered to        have sometimes seen when he looked at her  She stood several        minutes before the picture  in earnest contemplation  and        returned to it again before they quitted the gallery  Mrs         Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s        lifetime           There was certainly at this moment  in Elizabeth s mind  a more        gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at        the height of their acquaintance  The commendation bestowed on        him by Mrs  Reynolds was of no trifling nature  What praise is        more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant  As a        brother  a landlord  a master  she considered how many people s        happiness were in his guardianship  how much of pleasure or pain        was it in his power to bestow  how much of good or evil must be        done by him  Every idea that had been brought forward by the        housekeeper was favourable to his character  and as she stood        before the canvas on which he was represented  and fixed his eyes        upon herself  she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment        of gratitude than it had ever raised before  she remembered its        warmth  and softened its impropriety of expression           When all of the house that was open to general inspection had        been seen  they returned downstairs  and  taking leave of the        housekeeper  were consigned over to the gardener  who met them at        the hall door           As they walked across the hall towards the river  Elizabeth        turned back to look again  her uncle and aunt stopped also  and        while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building         the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road         which led behind it to the stables           They were within twenty yards of each other  and so abrupt was        his appearance  that it was impossible to avoid his sight  Their        eyes instantly met  and the cheeks of both were overspread with        the deepest blush  He absolutely started  and for a moment seemed        immovable from surprise  but shortly recovering himself  advanced        towards the party  and spoke to Elizabeth  if not in terms of        perfect composure  at least of perfect civility           She had instinctively turned away  but stopping on his approach         received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be        overcome  Had his first appearance  or his resemblance to the        picture they had just been examining  been insufficient to assure        the other two that they now saw Mr  Darcy  the gardener s        expression of surprise  on beholding his master  must immediately        have told it  They stood a little aloof while he was talking to        their niece  who  astonished and confused  scarcely dared lift        her eyes to his face  and knew not what answer she returned to        his civil enquiries after her family  Amazed at the alteration of        his manner since they last parted  every sentence that he uttered        was increasing her embarrassment  and every idea of the        impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind  the        few minutes in which they continued were some of the most        uncomfortable in her life  Nor did he seem much more at ease         when he spoke  his accent had none of its usual sedateness  and        he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left        Longbourn  and of her stay in Derbyshire  so often  and in so        hurried a way  as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts           At length every idea seemed to fail him  and  after standing a        few moments without saying a word  he suddenly recollected        himself  and took leave           The others then joined her  and expressed admiration of his        figure  but Elizabeth heard not a word  and wholly engrossed by        her own feelings  followed them in silence  She was overpowered        by shame and vexation  Her coming there was the most unfortunate         the most ill judged thing in the world  How strange it must        appear to him  In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so        vain a man  It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself        in his way again  Oh  why did she come  Or  why did he thus come        a day before he was expected  Had they been only ten minutes        sooner  they should have been beyond the reach of his        discrimination  for it was plain that he was that moment        arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage  She        blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting  And        his behaviour  so strikingly altered what could it mean  That he        should even speak to her was amazing  but to speak with such        civility  to enquire after her family  Never in her life had she        seen his manners so little dignified  never had he spoken with        such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting  What a contrast        did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park  when he put his        letter into her hand  She knew not what to think  or how to        account for it           They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water         and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground  or a        finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching  but it        was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it  and         though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her        uncle and aunt  and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as        they pointed out  she distinguished no part of the scene  Her        thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House         whichever it might be  where Mr  Darcy then was  She longed to        know what at the moment was passing in his mind in what manner he        thought of her  and whether  in defiance of everything  she was        still dear to him  Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt        himself at ease  yet there had been  that  in his voice which was        not like ease  Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in        seeing her she could not tell  but he certainly had not seen her        with composure           At length  however  the remarks of her companions on her absence        of mind aroused her  and she felt the necessity of appearing more        like herself           They entered the woods  and bidding adieu to the river for a        while  ascended some of the higher grounds  when  in spots where        the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander  were many        charming views of the valley  the opposite hills  with the long        range of woods overspreading many  and occasionally part of the        stream  Mr  Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole        park  but feared it might be beyond a walk  With a triumphant        smile they were told that it was ten miles round  It settled the        matter  and they pursued the accustomed circuit  which brought        them again  after some time  in a descent among hanging woods  to        the edge of the water  and one of its narrowest parts  They        crossed it by a simple bridge  in character with the general air        of the scene  it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet        visited  and the valley  here contracted into a glen  allowed        room only for the stream  and a narrow walk amidst the rough        coppice wood which bordered it  Elizabeth longed to explore its        windings  but when they had crossed the bridge  and perceived        their distance from the house  Mrs  Gardiner  who was not a great        walker  could go no farther  and thought only of returning to the        carriage as quickly as possible  Her niece was  therefore         obliged to submit  and they took their way towards the house on        the opposite side of the river  in the nearest direction  but        their progress was slow  for Mr  Gardiner  though seldom able to        indulge the taste  was very fond of fishing  and was so much        engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in        the water  and talking to the man about them  that he advanced        but little  Whilst wandering on in this slow manner  they were        again surprised  and Elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to        what it had been at first  by the sight of Mr  Darcy approaching        them  and at no great distance  The walk being here less        sheltered than on the other side  allowed them to see him before        they met  Elizabeth  however astonished  was at least more        prepared for an interview than before  and resolved to appear and        to speak with calmness  if he really intended to meet them  For a        few moments  indeed  she felt that he would probably strike into        some other path  The idea lasted while a turning in the walk        concealed him from their view  the turning past  he was        immediately before them  With a glance  she saw that he had lost        none of his recent civility  and  to imitate his politeness  she        began  as they met  to admire the beauty of the place  but she        had not got beyond the words  delightful   and  charming   when        some unlucky recollections obtruded  and she fancied that praise        of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed  Her        colour changed  and she said no more           Mrs  Gardiner was standing a little behind  and on her pausing         he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to        her friends  This was a stroke of civility for which she was        quite unprepared  and she could hardly suppress a smile at his        being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people        against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself          What will be his surprise   thought she   when he knows who they        are  He takes them now for people of fashion            The introduction  however  was immediately made  and as she named        their relationship to herself  she stole a sly look at him  to        see how he bore it  and was not without the expectation of his        decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions         That he was  surprised  by the connection was evident  he        sustained it  however  with fortitude  and so far from going        away  turned back with them  and entered into conversation with        Mr  Gardiner  Elizabeth could not but be pleased  could not but        triumph  It was consoling that he should know she had some        relations for whom there was no need to blush  She listened most        attentively to all that passed between them  and gloried in every        expression  every sentence of her uncle  which marked his        intelligence  his taste  or his good manners           The conversation soon turned upon fishing  and she heard Mr         Darcy invite him  with the greatest civility  to fish there as        often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood         offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle  and        pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually        most sport  Mrs  Gardiner  who was walking arm in arm with        Elizabeth  gave her a look expressive of wonder  Elizabeth said        nothing  but it gratified her exceedingly  the compliment must be        all for herself  Her astonishment  however  was extreme  and        continually was she repeating   Why is he so altered  From what        can it proceed  It cannot be for  me  it cannot be for  my  sake        that his manners are thus softened  My reproofs at Hunsford could        not work such a change as this  It is impossible that he should        still love me            After walking some time in this way  the two ladies in front  the        two gentlemen behind  on resuming their places  after descending        to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some        curious water plant  there chanced to be a little alteration  It        originated in Mrs  Gardiner  who  fatigued by the exercise of the        morning  found Elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support  and        consequently preferred her husband s  Mr  Darcy took her place by        her niece  and they walked on together  After a short silence         the lady first spoke  She wished him to know that she had been        assured of his absence before she came to the place  and        accordingly began by observing  that his arrival had been very        unexpected  for your housekeeper   she added   informed us that        you would certainly not be here till to morrow  and indeed         before we left Bakewell  we understood that you were not        immediately expected in the country   He acknowledged the truth        of it all  and said that business with his steward had occasioned        his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with        whom he had been travelling   They will join me early to morrow          he continued   and among them are some who will claim an        acquaintance with you Mr  Bingley and his sisters            Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow  Her thoughts were        instantly driven back to the time when Mr  Bingley s name had        been the last mentioned between them  and  if she might judge by        his complexion   his  mind was not very differently engaged            There is also one other person in the party   he continued after        a pause   who more particularly wishes to be known to you  Will        you allow me  or do I ask too much  to introduce my sister to        your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton            The surprise of such an application was great indeed  it was too        great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it  She        immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of        being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother  and         without looking farther  it was satisfactory  it was gratifying        to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of        her           They now walked on in silence  each of them deep in thought         Elizabeth was not comfortable  that was impossible  but she was        flattered and pleased  His wish of introducing his sister to her        was a compliment of the highest kind  They soon outstripped the        others  and when they had reached the carriage  Mr  and Mrs         Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind           He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself        not tired  and they stood together on the lawn  At such a time        much might have been said  and silence was very awkward  She        wanted to talk  but there seemed to be an embargo on every        subject  At last she recollected that she had been travelling         and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance         Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas        were nearly worn out before the  t te   t te  was over           On Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go        into the house and take some refreshment  but this was declined         and they parted on each side with utmost politeness  Mr  Darcy        handed the ladies into the carriage  and when it drove off         Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house           The observations of her uncle and aunt now began  and each of        them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they        had expected   He is perfectly well behaved  polite  and        unassuming   said her uncle            There  is  something a little stately in him  to be sure          replied her aunt   but it is confined to his air  and is not        unbecoming  I can now say with the housekeeper  that though some        people may call him proud   I  have seen nothing of it             I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us  It was        more than civil  it was really attentive  and there was no        necessity for such attention  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was        very trifling             To be sure  Lizzy   said her aunt   he is not so handsome as        Wickham  or  rather  he has not Wickham s countenance  for his        features are perfectly good  But how came you to tell me that he        was so disagreeable            Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could  said that she had        liked him better when they had met in Kent than before  and that        she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning            But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities          replied her uncle   Your great men often are  and therefore I        shall not take him at his word  as he might change his mind        another day  and warn me off his grounds            Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his        character  but said nothing            From what we have seen of him   continued Mrs  Gardiner   I        really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so        cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham  He has not        an ill natured look  On the contrary  there is something pleasing        about his mouth when he speaks  And there is something of dignity        in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea        of his heart  But  to be sure  the good lady who showed us his        house did give him a most flaming character  I could hardly help        laughing aloud sometimes  But he is a liberal master  I suppose         and  that  in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue            Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in        vindication of his behaviour to Wickham  and therefore gave them        to understand  in as guarded a manner as she could  that by what        she had heard from his relations in Kent  his actions were        capable of a very different construction  and that his character        was by no means so faulty  nor Wickham s so amiable  as they had        been considered in Hertfordshire  In confirmation of this  she        related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in        which they had been connected  without actually naming her        authority  but stating it to be such as might be relied on           Mrs  Gardiner was surprised and concerned  but as they were now        approaching the scene of her former pleasures  every idea gave        way to the charm of recollection  and she was too much engaged in        pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its        environs to think of anything else  Fatigued as she had been by        the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off        again in quest of her former acquaintance  and the evening was        spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many        years  discontinuance           The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave        Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends  and she        could do nothing but think  and think with wonder  of Mr  Darcy s        civility  and  above all  of his wishing her to be acquainted        with his sister           Chapter 44          Elizabeth had settled it that Mr  Darcy would bring his sister to        visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley  and was        consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole        of that morning  But her conclusion was false  for on the very        morning after their arrival at Lambton  these visitors came  They        had been walking about the place with some of their new friends         and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining        with the same family  when the sound of a carriage drew them to a        window  and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving        up the street  Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery         guessed what it meant  and imparted no small degree of her        surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour        which she expected  Her uncle and aunt were all amazement  and        the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke  joined to the        circumstance itself  and many of the circumstances of the        preceding day  opened to them a new idea on the business  Nothing        had ever suggested it before  but they felt that there was no        other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter        than by supposing a partiality for their niece  While these        newly born notions were passing in their heads  the perturbation        of Elizabeth s feelings was at every moment increasing  She was        quite amazed at her own discomposure  but amongst other causes of        disquiet  she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should        have said too much in her favour  and  more than commonly anxious        to please  she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing        would fail her           She retreated from the window  fearful of being seen  and as she        walked up and down the room  endeavouring to compose herself  saw        such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made        everything worse           Miss Darcy and her brother appeared  and this formidable        introduction took place  With astonishment did Elizabeth see that        her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself         Since her being at Lambton  she had heard that Miss Darcy was        exceedingly proud  but the observation of a very few minutes        convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy  She found it        difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable           Miss Darcy was tall  and on a larger scale than Elizabeth  and         though little more than sixteen  her figure was formed  and her        appearance womanly and graceful  She was less handsome than her        brother  but there was sense and good humour in her face  and her        manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle  Elizabeth  who had        expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as        ever Mr  Darcy had been  was much relieved by discerning such        different feelings           They had not long been together before Mr  Darcy told her that        Bingley was also coming to wait on her  and she had barely time        to express her satisfaction  and prepare for such a visitor  when        Bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs  and in a moment he        entered the room  All Elizabeth s anger against him had been long        done away  but had she still felt any  it could hardly have stood        its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he        expressed himself on seeing her again  He enquired in a friendly         though general way  after her family  and looked and spoke with        the same good humoured ease that he had ever done           To Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting        personage than to herself  They had long wished to see him  The        whole party before them  indeed  excited a lively attention  The        suspicions which had just arisen of Mr  Darcy and their niece        directed their observation towards each with an earnest though        guarded enquiry  and they soon drew from those enquiries the full        conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love  Of        the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt  but that        the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough           Elizabeth  on her side  had much to do  She wanted to ascertain        the feelings of each of her visitors  she wanted to compose her        own  and to make herself agreeable to all  and in the latter        object  where she feared most to fail  she was most sure of        success  for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were        prepossessed in her favour  Bingley was ready  Georgiana was        eager  and Darcy determined  to be pleased           In seeing Bingley  her thoughts naturally flew to her sister         and  oh  how ardently did she long to know whether any of his        were directed in a like manner  Sometimes she could fancy that he        talked less than on former occasions  and once or twice pleased        herself with the notion that  as he looked at her  he was trying        to trace a resemblance  But  though this might be imaginary  she        could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy  who had        been set up as a rival to Jane  No look appeared on either side        that spoke particular regard  Nothing occurred between them that        could justify the hopes of his sister  On this point she was soon        satisfied  and two or three little circumstances occurred ere        they parted  which  in her anxious interpretation  denoted a        recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness  and a wish of        saying more that might lead to the mention of her  had he dared         He observed to her  at a moment when the others were talking        together  and in a tone which had something of real regret  that        it  was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing        her   and  before she could reply  he added   It is above eight        months  We have not met since the 26th of November  when we were        all dancing together at Netherfield            Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact  and he        afterwards took occasion to ask her  when unattended to by any of        the rest  whether  all  her sisters were at Longbourn  There was        not much in the question  nor in the preceding remark  but there        was a look and a manner which gave them meaning           It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr  Darcy        himself  but  whenever she did catch a glimpse  she saw an        expression of general complaisance  and in all that he said she        heard an accent so removed from  hauteur  or disdain of his        companions  as convinced her that the improvement of manners        which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence        might prove  had at least outlived one day  When she saw him thus        seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people        with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a        disgrace when she saw him thus civil  not only to herself  but to        the very relations whom he had openly disdained  and recollected        their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage the difference  the        change was so great  and struck so forcibly on her mind  that she        could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible  Never         even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield  or his        dignified relations at Rosings  had she seen him so desirous to        please  so free from self consequence or unbending reserve  as        now  when no importance could result from the success of his        endeavours  and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his        attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and        censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings           Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour  and when they        arose to depart  Mr  Darcy called on his sister to join him in        expressing their wish of seeing Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner  and Miss        Bennet  to dinner at Pemberley  before they left the country         Miss Darcy  though with a diffidence which marked her little in        the habit of giving invitations  readily obeyed  Mrs  Gardiner        looked at her niece  desirous of knowing how  she   whom the        invitation most concerned  felt disposed as to its acceptance         but Elizabeth had turned away her head  Presuming however  that        this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment        than any dislike of the proposal  and seeing in her husband  who        was fond of society  a perfect willingness to accept it  she        ventured to engage for her attendance  and the day after the next        was fixed on           Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing        Elizabeth again  having still a great deal to say to her  and        many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends         Elizabeth  construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak        of her sister  was pleased  and on this account  as well as some        others  found herself  when their visitors left them  capable of        considering the last half hour with some satisfaction  though        while it was passing  the enjoyment of it had been little  Eager        to be alone  and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and        aunt  she stayed with them only long enough to hear their        favourable opinion of Bingley  and then hurried away to dress           But she had no reason to fear Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner s curiosity         it was not their wish to force her communication  It was evident        that she was much better acquainted with Mr  Darcy than they had        before any idea of  it was evident that he was very much in love        with her  They saw much to interest  but nothing to justify        enquiry           Of Mr  Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well  and         as far as their acquaintance reached  there was no fault to find         They could not be untouched by his politeness  and had they drawn        his character from their own feelings and his servant s report         without any reference to any other account  the circle in        Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it        for Mr  Darcy  There was now an interest  however  in believing        the housekeeper  and they soon became sensible that the authority        of a servant who had known him since he was four years old  and        whose own manners indicated respectability  was not to be hastily        rejected  Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of        their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight         They had nothing to accuse him of but pride  pride he probably        had  and if not  it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants        of a small market town where the family did not visit  It was        acknowledged  however  that he was a liberal man  and did much        good among the poor           With respect to Wickham  the travellers soon found that he was        not held there in much estimation  for though the chief of his        concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood         it was yet a well known fact that  on his quitting Derbyshire  he        had left many debts behind him  which Mr  Darcy afterwards        discharged           As for Elizabeth  her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening        more than the last  and the evening  though as it passed it        seemed long  was not long enough to determine her feelings        towards  one  in that mansion  and she lay awake two whole hours        endeavouring to make them out  She certainly did not hate him         No  hatred had vanished long ago  and she had almost as long been        ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him  that could be so        called  The respect created by the conviction of his valuable        qualities  though at first unwillingly admitted  had for some        time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling  and it was now        heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature  by the testimony        so highly in his favour  and bringing forward his disposition in        so amiable a light  which yesterday had produced  But above all         above respect and esteem  there was a motive within her of        goodwill which could not be overlooked  It was gratitude         gratitude  not merely for having once loved her  but for loving        her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony        of her manner in rejecting him  and all the unjust accusations        accompanying her rejection  He who  she had been persuaded  would        avoid her as his greatest enemy  seemed  on this accidental        meeting  most eager to preserve the acquaintance  and without any        indelicate display of regard  or any peculiarity of manner  where        their two selves only were concerned  was soliciting the good        opinion of her friends  and bent on making her known to his        sister  Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only        astonishment but gratitude for to love  ardent love  it must be        attributed  and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be        encouraged  as by no means unpleasing  though it could not be        exactly defined  She respected  she esteemed  she was grateful to        him  she felt a real interest in his welfare  and she only wanted        to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself         and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should        employ the power  which her fancy told her she still possessed         of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses           It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the        niece  that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy s in coming to        see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley  for she had        reached it only to a late breakfast  ought to be imitated  though        it could not be equalled  by some exertion of politeness on their        side  and  consequently  that it would be highly expedient to        wait on her at Pemberley the following morning  They were         therefore  to go  Elizabeth was pleased  though when she asked        herself the reason  she had very little to say in reply           Mr  Gardiner left them soon after breakfast  The fishing scheme        had been renewed the day before  and a positive engagement made        of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon           Chapter 45          Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley s dislike of her        had originated in jealousy  she could not help feeling how        unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her  and was        curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the        acquaintance would now be renewed           On reaching the house  they were shown through the hall into the        saloon  whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer         Its windows opening to the ground  admitted a most refreshing        view of the high woody hills behind the house  and of the        beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over        the intermediate lawn           In this house they were received by Miss Darcy  who was sitting        there with Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley  and the lady with whom        she lived in London  Georgiana s reception of them was very        civil  but attended with all the embarrassment which  though        proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong  would easily        give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her        being proud and reserved  Mrs  Gardiner and her niece  however         did her justice  and pitied her           By Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a        curtsey  and  on their being seated  a pause  awkward as such        pauses must always be  succeeded for a few moments  It was first        broken by Mrs  Annesley  a genteel  agreeable looking woman         whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to        be more truly well bred than either of the others  and between        her and Mrs  Gardiner  with occasional help from Elizabeth  the        conversation was carried on  Miss Darcy looked as if she wished        for courage enough to join in it  and sometimes did venture a        short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard           Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss        Bingley  and that she could not speak a word  especially to Miss        Darcy  without calling her attention  This observation would not        have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter  had they        not been seated at an inconvenient distance  but she was not        sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much  Her own thoughts        were employing her  She expected every moment that some of the        gentlemen would enter the room  She wished  she feared that the        master of the house might be amongst them  and whether she wished        or feared it most  she could scarcely determine  After sitting in        this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley s        voice  Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry        after the health of her family  She answered with equal        indifference and brevity  and the other said no more           The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the        entrance of servants with cold meat  cake  and a variety of all        the finest fruits in season  but this did not take place till        after many a significant look and smile from Mrs  Annesley to        Miss Darcy had been given  to remind her of her post  There was        now employment for the whole party for though they could not all        talk  they could all eat  and the beautiful pyramids of grapes         nectarines  and peaches soon collected them round the table           While thus engaged  Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding        whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr         Darcy  by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room         and then  though but a moment before she had believed her wishes        to predominate  she began to regret that he came           He had been some time with Mr  Gardiner  who  with two or three        other gentlemen from the house  was engaged by the river  and had        left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended        a visit to Georgiana that morning  No sooner did he appear than        Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed         a resolution the more necessary to be made  but perhaps not the        more easily kept  because she saw that the suspicions of the        whole party were awakened against them  and that there was        scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first        came into the room  In no countenance was attentive curiosity so        strongly marked as in Miss Bingley s  in spite of the smiles        which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its        objects  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate  and her        attentions to Mr  Darcy were by no means over  Miss Darcy  on her        brother s entrance  exerted herself much more to talk  and        Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to        get acquainted  and forwarded as much as possible  every attempt        at conversation on either side  Miss Bingley saw all this        likewise  and  in the imprudence of anger  took the first        opportunity of saying  with sneering civility            Pray  Miss Eliza  are not the   shire Militia removed from        Meryton  They must be a great loss to  your  family            In Darcy s presence she dared not mention Wickham s name  but        Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her        thoughts  and the various recollections connected with him gave        her a moment s distress  but exerting herself vigorously to repel        the ill natured attack  she presently answered the question in a        tolerably detached tone  While she spoke  an involuntary glance        showed her Darcy  with a heightened complexion  earnestly looking        at her  and his sister overcome with confusion  and unable to        lift up her eyes  Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then        giving her beloved friend  she undoubtedly would have refrained        from the hint  but she had merely intended to discompose        Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she        believed her partial  to make her betray a sensibility which        might injure her in Darcy s opinion  and  perhaps  to remind the        latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of        her family were connected with that corps  Not a syllable had        ever reached her of Miss Darcy s meditated elopement  To no        creature had it been revealed  where secrecy was possible  except        to Elizabeth  and from all Bingley s connections her brother was        particularly anxious to conceal it  from the very wish which        Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him  of their becoming        hereafter her own  He had certainly formed such a plan  and        without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate        him from Miss Bennet  it is probable that it might add something        to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend           Elizabeth s collected behaviour  however  soon quieted his        emotion  and as Miss Bingley  vexed and disappointed  dared not        approach nearer to Wickham  Georgiana also recovered in time         though not enough to be able to speak any more  Her brother         whose eye she feared to meet  scarcely recollected her interest        in the affair  and the very circumstance which had been designed        to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on        her more and more cheerfully           Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer        above mentioned  and while Mr  Darcy was attending them to their        carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on        Elizabeth s person  behaviour  and dress  But Georgiana would not        join her  Her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her        favour  his judgement could not err  And he had spoken in such        terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of        finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable  When Darcy        returned to the saloon  Miss Bingley could not help repeating to        him some part of what she had been saying to his sister            How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning  Mr  Darcy          she cried   I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she        is since the winter  She is grown so brown and coarse  Louisa and        I were agreeing that we should not have known her again            However little Mr  Darcy might have liked such an address  he        contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other        alteration than her being rather tanned  no miraculous        consequence of travelling in the summer            For my own part   she rejoined   I must confess that I never        could see any beauty in her  Her face is too thin  her complexion        has no brilliancy  and her features are not at all handsome  Her        nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines  Her        teeth are tolerable  but not out of the common way  and as for        her eyes  which have sometimes been called so fine  I could never        see anything extraordinary in them  They have a sharp  shrewish        look  which I do not like at all  and in her air altogether there        is a self sufficiency without fashion  which is intolerable            Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth  this        was not the best method of recommending herself  but angry people        are not always wise  and in seeing him at last look somewhat        nettled  she had all the success she expected  He was resolutely        silent  however  and  from a determination of making him speak         she continued            I remember  when we first knew her in Hertfordshire  how amazed        we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty  and I        particularly recollect your saying one night  after they had been        dining at Netherfield    She  a beauty  I should as soon call her        mother a wit   But afterwards she seemed to improve on you  and I        believe you thought her rather pretty at one time             Yes   replied Darcy  who could contain himself no longer   but         that  was only when I first saw her  for it is many months since        I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my        acquaintance            He then went away  and Miss Bingley was left to all the        satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any        pain but herself           Mrs  Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred        during their visit  as they returned  except what had        particularly interested them both  The look and behaviour of        everybody they had seen were discussed  except of the person who        had mostly engaged their attention  They talked of his sister         his friends  his house  his fruit of everything but himself  yet        Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs  Gardiner thought of him         and Mrs  Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s        beginning the subject           Chapter 46          Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a        letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton  and this        disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had        now been spent there  but on the third her repining was over  and        her sister justified  by the receipt of two letters from her at        once  on one of which was marked that it had been missent        elsewhere  Elizabeth was not surprised at it  as Jane had written        the direction remarkably ill           They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in  and        her uncle and aunt  leaving her to enjoy them in quiet  set off        by themselves  The one missent must first be attended to  it had        been written five days ago  The beginning contained an account of        all their little parties and engagements  with such news as the        country afforded  but the latter half  which was dated a day        later  and written in evident agitation  gave more important        intelligence  It was to this effect            Since writing the above  dearest Lizzy  something has occurred        of a most unexpected and serious nature  but I am afraid of        alarming you be assured that we are all well  What I have to say        relates to poor Lydia  An express came at twelve last night  just        as we were all gone to bed  from Colonel Forster  to inform us        that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers  to        own the truth  with Wickham  Imagine our surprise  To Kitty         however  it does not seem so wholly unexpected  I am very  very        sorry  So imprudent a match on both sides  But I am willing to        hope the best  and that his character has been misunderstood         Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him  but this        step  and let us rejoice over it  marks nothing bad at heart  His        choice is disinterested at least  for he must know my father can        give her nothing  Our poor mother is sadly grieved  My father        bears it better  How thankful am I that we never let them know        what has been said against him  we must forget it ourselves  They        were off Saturday night about twelve  as is conjectured  but were        not missed till yesterday morning at eight  The express was sent        off directly  My dear Lizzy  they must have passed within ten        miles of us  Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here        soon  Lydia left a few lines for his wife  informing her of their        intention  I must conclude  for I cannot be long from my poor        mother  I am afraid you will not be able to make it out  but I        hardly know what I have written            Without allowing herself time for consideration  and scarcely        knowing what she felt  Elizabeth on finishing this letter        instantly seized the other  and opening it with the utmost        impatience  read as follows  it had been written a day later than        the conclusion of the first            By this time  my dearest sister  you have received my hurried        letter  I wish this may be more intelligible  but though not        confined for time  my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer        for being coherent  Dearest Lizzy  I hardly know what I would        write  but I have bad news for you  and it cannot be delayed         Imprudent as the marriage between Mr  Wickham and our poor Lydia        would be  we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place         for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to        Scotland  Colonel Forster came yesterday  having left Brighton        the day before  not many hours after the express  Though Lydia s        short letter to Mrs  F  gave them to understand that they were        going to Gretna Green  something was dropped by Denny expressing        his belief that W  never intended to go there  or to marry Lydia        at all  which was repeated to Colonel F   who  instantly taking        the alarm  set off from B  intending to trace their route  He did        trace them easily to Clapham  but no further  for on entering        that place  they removed into a hackney coach  and dismissed the        chaise that brought them from Epsom  All that is known after this        is  that they were seen to continue the London road  I know not        what to think  After making every possible enquiry on that side        London  Colonel F  came on into Hertfordshire  anxiously renewing        them at all the turnpikes  and at the inns in Barnet and        Hatfield  but without any success no such people had been seen to        pass through  With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn         and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to        his heart  I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs  F   but no one        can throw any blame on them  Our distress  my dear Lizzy  is very        great  My father and mother believe the worst  but I cannot think        so ill of him  Many circumstances might make it more eligible for        them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first        plan  and even if  he  could form such a design against a young        woman of Lydia s connections  which is not likely  can I suppose        her so lost to everything  Impossible  I grieve to find  however         that Colonel F  is not disposed to depend upon their marriage  he        shook his head when I expressed my hopes  and said he feared W         was not a man to be trusted  My poor mother is really ill  and        keeps her room  Could she exert herself  it would be better  but        this is not to be expected  And as to my father  I never in my        life saw him so affected  Poor Kitty has anger for having        concealed their attachment  but as it was a matter of confidence         one cannot wonder  I am truly glad  dearest Lizzy  that you have        been spared something of these distressing scenes  but now  as        the first shock is over  shall I own that I long for your return         I am not so selfish  however  as to press for it  if        inconvenient  Adieu  I take up my pen again to do what I have        just told you I would not  but circumstances are such that I        cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as        possible  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well  that I am not        afraid of requesting it  though I have still something more to        ask of the former  My father is going to London with Colonel        Forster instantly  to try to discover her  What he means to do I        am sure I know not  but his excessive distress will not allow him        to pursue any measure in the best and safest way  and Colonel        Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening  In        such an exigence  my uncle s advice and assistance would be        everything in the world  he will immediately comprehend what I        must feel  and I rely upon his goodness             Oh  where  where is my uncle   cried Elizabeth  darting from her        seat as she finished the letter  in eagerness to follow him         without losing a moment of the time so precious  but as she        reached the door it was opened by a servant  and Mr  Darcy        appeared  Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start  and        before he could recover himself to speak  she  in whose mind        every idea was superseded by Lydia s situation  hastily        exclaimed   I beg your pardon  but I must leave you  I must find        Mr  Gardiner this moment  on business that cannot be delayed  I        have not an instant to lose             Good God  what is the matter   cried he  with more feeling than        politeness  then recollecting himself   I will not detain you a        minute  but let me  or let the servant go after Mr  and Mrs         Gardiner  You are not well enough  you cannot go yourself            Elizabeth hesitated  but her knees trembled under her and she        felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them         Calling back the servant  therefore  she commissioned him  though        in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible  to        fetch his master and mistress home instantly           On his quitting the room she sat down  unable to support herself         and looking so miserably ill  that it was impossible for Darcy to        leave her  or to refrain from saying  in a tone of gentleness and        commiseration   Let me call your maid  Is there nothing you could        take to give you present relief  A glass of wine  shall I get you        one  You are very ill             No  I thank you   she replied  endeavouring to recover herself          There is nothing the matter with me  I am quite well  I am only        distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from        Longbourn            She burst into tears as she alluded to it  and for a few minutes        could not speak another word  Darcy  in wretched suspense  could        only say something indistinctly of his concern  and observe her        in compassionate silence  At length she spoke again   I have just        had a letter from Jane  with such dreadful news  It cannot be        concealed from anyone  My younger sister has left all her        friends has eloped  has thrown herself into the power of of Mr         Wickham  They are gone off together from Brighton   You  know him        too well to doubt the rest  She has no money  no connections         nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever            Darcy was fixed in astonishment   When I consider   she added in        a yet more agitated voice   that  I  might have prevented it   I         who knew what he was  Had I but explained some part of it        only some part of what I learnt  to my own family  Had his        character been known  this could not have happened  But it is        all all too late now             I am grieved indeed   cried Darcy   grieved shocked  But is it        certain absolutely certain             Oh  yes  They left Brighton together on Sunday night  and were        traced almost to London  but not beyond  they are certainly not        gone to Scotland             And what has been done  what has been attempted  to recover        her             My father is gone to London  and Jane has written to beg my        uncle s immediate assistance  and we shall be off  I hope  in        half an hour  But nothing can be done I know very well that        nothing can be done  How is such a man to be worked on  How are        they even to be discovered  I have not the smallest hope  It is        every way horrible            Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence            When  my  eyes were opened to his real character Oh  had I known        what I ought  what I dared to do  But I knew not I was afraid of        doing too much  Wretched  wretched mistake            Darcy made no answer  He seemed scarcely to hear her  and was        walking up and down the room in earnest meditation  his brow        contracted  his air gloomy  Elizabeth soon observed  and        instantly understood it  Her power was sinking  everything  must         sink under such a proof of family weakness  such an assurance of        the deepest disgrace  She could neither wonder nor condemn  but        the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to        her bosom  afforded no palliation of her distress  It was  on the        contrary  exactly calculated to make her understand her own        wishes  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have        loved him  as now  when all love must be vain           But self  though it would intrude  could not engross her         Lydia the humiliation  the misery she was bringing on them all         soon swallowed up every private care  and covering her face with        her handkerchief  Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else         and  after a pause of several minutes  was only recalled to a        sense of her situation by the voice of her companion  who  in a        manner which  though it spoke compassion  spoke likewise        restraint  said   I am afraid you have been long desiring my        absence  nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay  but        real  though unavailing concern  Would to Heaven that anything        could be either said or done on my part that might offer        consolation to such distress  But I will not torment you with        vain wishes  which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks         This unfortunate affair will  I fear  prevent my sister s having        the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day             Oh  yes  Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy  Say        that urgent business calls us home immediately  Conceal the        unhappy truth as long as it is possible  I know it cannot be        long            He readily assured her of his secrecy  again expressed his sorrow        for her distress  wished it a happier conclusion than there was        at present reason to hope  and leaving his compliments for her        relations  with only one serious  parting look  went away           As he quitted the room  Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that        they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality        as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire  and as she        threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their        acquaintance  so full of contradictions and varieties  sighed at        the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted        its continuance  and would formerly have rejoiced in its        termination           If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection         Elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor        faulty  But if otherwise if regard springing from such sources is        unreasonable or unnatural  in comparison of what is so often        described as arising on a first interview with its object  and        even before two words have been exchanged  nothing can be said in        her defence  except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the        latter method in her partiality for Wickham  and that its ill        success might  perhaps  authorise her to seek the other less        interesting mode of attachment  Be that as it may  she saw him go        with regret  and in this early example of what Lydia s infamy        must produce  found additional anguish as she reflected on that        wretched business  Never  since reading Jane s second letter  had        she entertained a hope of Wickham s meaning to marry her  No one        but Jane  she thought  could flatter herself with such an        expectation  Surprise was the least of her feelings on this        development  While the contents of the first letter remained in        her mind  she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham        should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for        money  and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared        incomprehensible  But now it was all too natural  For such an        attachment as this she might have sufficient charms  and though        she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an        elopement without the intention of marriage  she had no        difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her        understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey           She had never perceived  while the regiment was in Hertfordshire         that Lydia had any partiality for him  but she was convinced that        Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody         Sometimes one officer  sometimes another  had been her favourite         as their attentions raised them in her opinion  Her affections        had continually been fluctuating but never without an object  The        mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a        girl oh  how acutely did she now feel it           She was wild to be at home to hear  to see  to be upon the spot        to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon        her  in a family so deranged  a father absent  a mother incapable        of exertion  and requiring constant attendance  and though almost        persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia  her uncle s        interference seemed of the utmost importance  and till he entered        the room her impatience was severe  Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner had        hurried back in alarm  supposing by the servant s account that        their niece was taken suddenly ill  but satisfying them instantly        on that head  she eagerly communicated the cause of their        summons  reading the two letters aloud  and dwelling on the        postscript of the last with trembling energy   Though Lydia had        never been a favourite with them  Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner could not        but be deeply afflicted  Not Lydia only  but all were concerned        in it  and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror         Mr  Gardiner promised every assistance in his power  Elizabeth         though expecting no less  thanked him with tears of gratitude         and all three being actuated by one spirit  everything relating        to their journey was speedily settled  They were to be off as        soon as possible   But what is to be done about Pemberley   cried        Mrs  Gardiner   John told us Mr  Darcy was here when you sent for        us  was it so             Yes  and I told him we should not be able to keep our        engagement   That  is all settled             That is all settled   repeated the other  as she ran into her        room to prepare   And are they upon such terms as for her to        disclose the real truth  Oh  that I knew how it was            But wishes were vain  or at least could only serve to amuse her        in the hurry and confusion of the following hour  Had Elizabeth        been at leisure to be idle  she would have remained certain that        all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself  but        she had her share of business as well as her aunt  and amongst        the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at        Lambton  with false excuses for their sudden departure  An hour         however  saw the whole completed  and Mr  Gardiner meanwhile        having settled his account at the inn  nothing remained to be        done but to go  and Elizabeth  after all the misery of the        morning  found herself  in a shorter space of time than she could        have supposed  seated in the carriage  and on the road to        Longbourn           Chapter 47           I have been thinking it over again  Elizabeth   said her uncle         as they drove from the town   and really  upon serious        consideration  I am much more inclined than I was to judge as        your eldest sister does on the matter  It appears to me so very        unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a        girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless  and who was        actually staying in his colonel s family  that I am strongly        inclined to hope the best  Could he expect that her friends would        not step forward  Could he expect to be noticed again by the        regiment  after such an affront to Colonel Forster  His        temptation is not adequate to the risk             Do you really think so   cried Elizabeth  brightening up for a        moment            Upon my word   said Mrs  Gardiner   I begin to be of your        uncle s opinion  It is really too great a violation of decency         honour  and interest  for him to be guilty of  I cannot think so        very ill of Wickham  Can you yourself  Lizzy  so wholly give him        up  as to believe him capable of it             Not  perhaps  of neglecting his own interest  but of every other        neglect I can believe him capable  If  indeed  it should be so         But I dare not hope it  Why should they not go on to Scotland if        that had been the case             In the first place   replied Mr  Gardiner   there is no absolute        proof that they are not gone to Scotland             Oh  but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is        such a presumption  And  besides  no traces of them were to be        found on the Barnet road             Well  then supposing them to be in London  They may be there         though for the purpose of concealment  for no more exceptional        purpose  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on        either side  and it might strike them that they could be more        economically  though less expeditiously  married in London than        in Scotland             But why all this secrecy  Why any fear of detection  Why must        their marriage be private  Oh  no  no this is not likely  His        most particular friend  you see by Jane s account  was persuaded        of his never intending to marry her  Wickham will never marry a        woman without some money  He cannot afford it  And what claims        has Lydia what attraction has she beyond youth  health  and good        humour that could make him  for her sake  forego every chance of        benefiting himself by marrying well  As to what restraint the        apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a        dishonourable elopement with her  I am not able to judge  for I        know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce  But        as to your other objection  I am afraid it will hardly hold good         Lydia has no brothers to step forward  and he might imagine  from        my father s behaviour  from his indolence and the little        attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in        his family  that  he  would do as little  and think as little        about it  as any father could do  in such a matter             But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love        of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than        marriage             It does seem  and it is most shocking indeed   replied        Elizabeth  with tears in her eyes   that a sister s sense of        decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt  But         really  I know not what to say  Perhaps I am not doing her        justice  But she is very young  she has never been taught to        think on serious subjects  and for the last half year  nay  for a        twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and        vanity  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most        idle and frivolous manner  and to adopt any opinions that came in        her way  Since the   shire were first quartered in Meryton         nothing but love  flirtation  and officers have been in her head         She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and        talking on the subject  to give greater what shall I call it         susceptibility to her feelings  which are naturally lively        enough  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person        and address that can captivate a woman             But you see that Jane   said her aunt   does not think so very        ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt             Of whom does Jane ever think ill  And who is there  whatever        might be their former conduct  that she would think capable of        such an attempt  till it were proved against them  But Jane        knows  as well as I do  what Wickham really is  We both know that        he has been profligate in every sense of the word  that he has        neither integrity nor honour  that he is as false and deceitful        as he is insinuating             And do you really know all this   cried Mrs  Gardiner  whose        curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive            I do indeed   replied Elizabeth  colouring   I told you  the        other day  of his infamous behaviour to Mr  Darcy  and you        yourself  when last at Longbourn  heard in what manner he spoke        of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality        towards him  And there are other circumstances which I am not at        liberty which it is not worth while to relate  but his lies about        the whole Pemberley family are endless  From what he said of Miss        Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud  reserved         disagreeable girl  Yet he knew to the contrary himself  He must        know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found        her             But does Lydia know nothing of this  can she be ignorant of what        you and Jane seem so well to understand             Oh  yes  that  that is the worst of all  Till I was in Kent  and        saw so much both of Mr  Darcy and his relation Colonel        Fitzwilliam  I was ignorant of the truth myself  And when I        returned home  the   shire was to leave Meryton in a week or        fortnight s time  As that was the case  neither Jane  to whom I        related the whole  nor I  thought it necessary to make our        knowledge public  for of what use could it apparently be to any        one  that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him        should then be overthrown  And even when it was settled that        Lydia should go with Mrs  Forster  the necessity of opening her        eyes to his character never occurred to me  That  she  could be        in any danger from the deception never entered my head  That such        a consequence as  this  could ensue  you may easily believe  was        far enough from my thoughts             When they all removed to Brighton  therefore  you had no reason         I suppose  to believe them fond of each other             Not the slightest  I can remember no symptom of affection on        either side  and had anything of the kind been perceptible  you        must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be        thrown away  When first he entered the corps  she was ready        enough to admire him  but so we all were  Every girl in or near        Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months         but he never distinguished  her  by any particular attention         and  consequently  after a moderate period of extravagant and        wild admiration  her fancy for him gave way  and others of the        regiment  who treated her with more distinction  again became her        favourites            It may be easily believed  that however little of novelty could        be added to their fears  hopes  and conjectures  on this        interesting subject  by its repeated discussion  no other could        detain them from it long  during the whole of the journey  From        Elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent  Fixed there by the        keenest of all anguish  self reproach  she could find no interval        of ease or forgetfulness           They travelled as expeditiously as possible  and  sleeping one        night on the road  reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day         It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not        have been wearied by long expectations           The little Gardiners  attracted by the sight of a chaise  were        standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock         and  when the carriage drove up to the door  the joyful surprise        that lighted up their faces  and displayed itself over their        whole bodies  in a variety of capers and frisks  was the first        pleasing earnest of their welcome           Elizabeth jumped out  and  after giving each of them a hasty        kiss  hurried into the vestibule  where Jane  who came running        down from her mother s apartment  immediately met her           Elizabeth  as she affectionately embraced her  whilst tears        filled the eyes of both  lost not a moment in asking whether        anything had been heard of the fugitives            Not yet   replied Jane   But now that my dear uncle is come  I        hope everything will be well             Is my father in town             Yes  he went on Tuesday  as I wrote you word             And have you heard from him often             We have heard only twice  He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday        to say that he had arrived in safety  and to give me his        directions  which I particularly begged him to do  He merely        added that he should not write again till he had something of        importance to mention             And my mother how is she  How are you all             My mother is tolerably well  I trust  though her spirits are        greatly shaken  She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction        in seeing you all  She does not yet leave her dressing room  Mary        and Kitty  thank Heaven  are quite well             But you how are you   cried Elizabeth   You look pale  How much        you must have gone through            Her sister  however  assured her of her being perfectly well  and        their conversation  which had been passing while Mr  and Mrs         Gardiner were engaged with their children  was now put an end to        by the approach of the whole party  Jane ran to her uncle and        aunt  and welcomed and thanked them both  with alternate smiles        and tears           When they were all in the drawing room  the questions which        Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the        others  and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to        give  The sanguine hope of good  however  which the benevolence        of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her  she still        expected that it would all end well  and that every morning would        bring some letter  either from Lydia or her father  to explain        their proceedings  and  perhaps  announce their marriage           Mrs  Bennet  to whose apartment they all repaired  after a few        minutes  conversation together  received them exactly as might be        expected  with tears and lamentations of regret  invectives        against the villainous conduct of Wickham  and complaints of her        own sufferings and ill usage  blaming everybody but the person to        whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must        principally be owing            If I had been able   said she   to carry my point in going to        Brighton  with all my family   this  would not have happened  but        poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her  Why did the        Forsters ever let her go out of their sight  I am sure there was        some great neglect or other on their side  for she is not the        kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked        after  I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge        of her  but I was overruled  as I always am  Poor dear child  And        now here s Mr  Bennet gone away  and I know he will fight        Wickham  wherever he meets him and then he will be killed  and        what is to become of us all  The Collinses will turn us out        before he is cold in his grave  and if you are not kind to us         brother  I do not know what we shall do            They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas  and Mr  Gardiner         after general assurances of his affection for her and all her        family  told her that he meant to be in London the very next day         and would assist Mr  Bennet in every endeavour for recovering        Lydia            Do not give way to useless alarm   added he   though it is right        to be prepared for the worst  there is no occasion to look on it        as certain  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton  In a        few days more we may gain some news of them  and till we know        that they are not married  and have no design of marrying  do not        let us give the matter over as lost  As soon as I get to town I        shall go to my brother  and make him come home with me to        Gracechurch Street  and then we may consult together as to what        is to be done             Oh  my dear brother   replied Mrs  Bennet   that is exactly what        I could most wish for  And now do  when you get to town  find        them out  wherever they may be  and if they are not married        already   make  them marry  And as for wedding clothes  do not        let them wait for that  but tell Lydia she shall have as much        money as she chooses to buy them  after they are married  And         above all  keep Mr  Bennet from fighting  Tell him what a        dreadful state I am in  that I am frighted out of my wits and        have such tremblings  such flutterings  all over me such spasms        in my side and pains in my head  and such beatings at heart  that        I can get no rest by night nor by day  And tell my dear Lydia not        to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me         for she does not know which are the best warehouses  Oh  brother         how kind you are  I know you will contrive it all            But Mr  Gardiner  though he assured her again of his earnest        endeavours in the cause  could not avoid recommending moderation        to her  as well in her hopes as her fear  and after talking with        her in this manner till dinner was on the table  they all left        her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper  who attended in        the absence of her daughters           Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no        real occasion for such a seclusion from the family  they did not        attempt to oppose it  for they knew that she had not prudence        enough to hold her tongue before the servants  while they waited        at table  and judged it better that  one  only of the household         and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her        fears and solicitude on the subject           In the dining room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty  who        had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make        their appearance before  One came from her books  and the other        from her toilette  The faces of both  however  were tolerably        calm  and no change was visible in either  except that the loss        of her favourite sister  or the anger which she had herself        incurred in this business  had given more of fretfulness than        usual to the accents of Kitty  As for Mary  she was mistress        enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth  with a countenance of        grave reflection  soon after they were seated at table            This is a most unfortunate affair  and will probably be much        talked of  But we must stem the tide of malice  and pour into the        wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation            Then  perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying  she        added   Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia  we may draw from        it this useful lesson  that loss of virtue in a female is        irretrievable  that one false step involves her in endless ruin         that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful  and        that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the        undeserving of the other sex            Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement  but was too much        oppressed to make any reply  Mary  however  continued to console        herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before        them           In the afternoon  the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for        half an hour by themselves  and Elizabeth instantly availed        herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries  which Jane        was equally eager to satisfy  After joining in general        lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event  which        Elizabeth considered as all but certain  and Miss Bennet could        not assert to be wholly impossible  the former continued the        subject  by saying   But tell me all and everything about it        which I have not already heard  Give me further particulars  What        did Colonel Forster say  Had they no apprehension of anything        before the elopement took place  They must have seen them        together for ever             Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some        partiality  especially on Lydia s side  but nothing to give him        any alarm  I am so grieved for him  His behaviour was attentive        and kind to the utmost  He  was  coming to us  in order to assure        us of his concern  before he had any idea of their not being gone        to Scotland  when that apprehension first got abroad  it hastened        his journey             And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry  Did he        know of their intending to go off  Had Colonel Forster seen Denny        himself             Yes  but  when questioned by  him   Denny denied knowing        anything of their plans  and would not give his real opinion        about it  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not        marrying and from  that   I am inclined to hope  he might have        been misunderstood before             And till Colonel Forster came himself  not one of you        entertained a doubt  I suppose  of their being really married             How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains  I        felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness        with him in marriage  because I knew that his conduct had not        been always quite right  My father and mother knew nothing of        that  they only felt how imprudent a match it must be  Kitty then        owned  with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest        of us  that in Lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such        a step  She had known  it seems  of their being in love with each        other  many weeks             But not before they went to Brighton             No  I believe not             And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself         Does he know his real character             I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he        formerly did  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant         And since this sad affair has taken place  it is said that he        left Meryton greatly in debt  but I hope this may be false             Oh  Jane  had we been less secret  had we told what we knew of        him  this could not have happened             Perhaps it would have been better   replied her sister   But to        expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their        present feelings were  seemed unjustifiable  We acted with the        best intentions             Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia s note to        his wife             He brought it with him for us to see            Jane then took it from her pocket book  and gave it to Elizabeth         These were the contents            My dear Harriet          You will laugh when you know where I am gone  and I cannot help        laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning  as soon as I        am missed  I am going to Gretna Green  and if you cannot guess        with who  I shall think you a simpleton  for there is but one man        in the world I love  and he is an angel  I should never be happy        without him  so think it no harm to be off  You need not send        them word at Longbourn of my going  if you do not like it  for it        will make the surprise the greater  when I write to them and sign        my name  Lydia Wickham   What a good joke it will be  I can        hardly write for laughing  Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not        keeping my engagement  and dancing with him to night  Tell him I        hope he will excuse me when he knows all  and tell him I will        dance with him at the next ball we meet  with great pleasure  I        shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn  but I wish you        would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown        before they are packed up  Good bye  Give my love to Colonel        Forster  I hope you will drink to our good journey            Your affectionate friend          LYDIA BENNET             Oh  thoughtless  thoughtless Lydia   cried Elizabeth when she        had finished it   What a letter is this  to be written at such a        moment  But at least it shows that  she  was serious on the        subject of their journey  Whatever he might afterwards persuade        her to  it was not on her side a  scheme  of infamy  My poor        father  how he must have felt it             I never saw anyone so shocked  He could not speak a word for        full ten minutes  My mother was taken ill immediately  and the        whole house in such confusion             Oh  Jane   cried Elizabeth   was there a servant belonging to it        who did not know the whole story before the end of the day             I do not know  I hope there was  But to be guarded at such a        time is very difficult  My mother was in hysterics  and though I        endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power  I am afraid        I did not do so much as I might have done  But the horror of what        might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties             Your attendance upon her has been too much for you  You do not        look well  Oh that I had been with you  you have had every care        and anxiety upon yourself alone             Mary and Kitty have been very kind  and would have shared in        every fatigue  I am sure  but I did not think it right for either        of them  Kitty is slight and delicate  and Mary studies so much         that her hours of repose should not be broken in on  My aunt        Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday  after my father went away         and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me  She was of        great use and comfort to us all  And Lady Lucas has been very        kind  she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us         and offered her services  or any of her daughters   if they        should be of use to us             She had better have stayed at home   cried Elizabeth   perhaps        she  meant  well  but  under such a misfortune as this  one        cannot see too little of one s neighbours  Assistance is        impossible  condolence insufferable  Let them triumph over us at        a distance  and be satisfied            She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father        had intended to pursue  while in town  for the recovery of his        daughter            He meant I believe   replied Jane   to go to Epsom  the place        where they last changed horses  see the postilions and try if        anything could be made out from them  His principal object must        be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them        from Clapham  It had come with a fare from London  and as he        thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing        from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make        enquiries at Clapham  If he could anyhow discover at what house        the coachman had before set down his fare  he determined to make        enquiries there  and hoped it might not be impossible to find out        the stand and number of the coach  I do not know of any other        designs that he had formed  but he was in such a hurry to be        gone  and his spirits so greatly discomposed  that I had        difficulty in finding out even so much as this            Chapter 48          The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr  Bennet the        next morning  but the post came in without bringing a single line        from him  His family knew him to be  on all common occasions  a        most negligent and dilatory correspondent  but at such a time        they had hoped for exertion  They were forced to conclude that he        had no pleasing intelligence to send  but even of  that  they        would have been glad to be certain  Mr  Gardiner had waited only        for the letters before he set off           When he was gone  they were certain at least of receiving        constant information of what was going on  and their uncle        promised  at parting  to prevail on Mr  Bennet to return to        Longbourn  as soon as he could  to the great consolation of his        sister  who considered it as the only security for her husband s        not being killed in a duel           Mrs  Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a        few days longer  as the former thought her presence might be        serviceable to her nieces  She shared in their attendance on Mrs         Bennet  and was a great comfort to them in their hours of        freedom  Their other aunt also visited them frequently  and        always  as she said  with the design of cheering and heartening        them up though  as she never came without reporting some fresh        instance of Wickham s extravagance or irregularity  she seldom        went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found        them           All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who  but three        months before  had been almost an angel of light  He was declared        to be in debt to every tradesman in the place  and his intrigues         all honoured with the title of seduction  had been extended into        every tradesman s family  Everybody declared that he was the        wickedest young man in the world  and everybody began to find out        that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness         Elizabeth  though she did not credit above half of what was said         believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin        more certain  and even Jane  who believed still less of it         became almost hopeless  more especially as the time was now come        when  if they had gone to Scotland  which she had never before        entirely despaired of  they must in all probability have gained        some news of them           Mr  Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday  on Tuesday his wife        received a letter from him  it told them that  on his arrival  he        had immediately found out his brother  and persuaded him to come        to Gracechurch Street  that Mr  Bennet had been to Epsom and        Clapham  before his arrival  but without gaining any satisfactory        information  and that he was now determined to enquire at all the        principal hotels in town  as Mr  Bennet thought it possible they        might have gone to one of them  on their first coming to London         before they procured lodgings  Mr  Gardiner himself did not        expect any success from this measure  but as his brother was        eager in it  he meant to assist him in pursuing it  He added that        Mr  Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London        and promised to write again very soon  There was also a        postscript to this effect            I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out  if        possible  from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment         whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be        likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself         If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability        of gaining such a clue as that  it might be of essential        consequence  At present we have nothing to guide us  Colonel        Forster will  I dare say  do everything in his power to satisfy        us on this head  But  on second thoughts  perhaps  Lizzy could        tell us what relations he has now living  better than any other        person            Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference        to her authority proceeded  but it was not in her power to give        any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment        deserved  She had never heard of his having had any relations         except a father and mother  both of whom had been dead many        years  It was possible  however  that some of his companions in        the   shire might be able to give more information  and though        she was not very sanguine in expecting it  the application was a        something to look forward to           Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety  but the most        anxious part of each was when the post was expected  The arrival        of letters was the grand object of every morning s impatience         Through letters  whatever of good or bad was to be told would be        communicated  and every succeeding day was expected to bring some        news of importance           But before they heard again from Mr  Gardiner  a letter arrived        for their father  from a different quarter  from Mr  Collins         which  as Jane had received directions to open all that came for        him in his absence  she accordingly read  and Elizabeth  who knew        what curiosities his letters always were  looked over her  and        read it likewise  It was as follows            My dear Sir          I feel myself called upon  by our relationship  and my situation        in life  to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are        now suffering under  of which we were yesterday informed by a        letter from Hertfordshire  Be assured  my dear sir  that Mrs         Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your        respectable family  in your present distress  which must be of        the bitterest kind  because proceeding from a cause which no time        can remove  No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can        alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you  under a        circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a        parent s mind  The death of your daughter would have been a        blessing in comparison of this  And it is the more to be        lamented  because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte        informs me  that this licentiousness of behaviour in your        daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence         though  at the same time  for the consolation of yourself and        Mrs  Bennet  I am inclined to think that her own disposition must        be naturally bad  or she could not be guilty of such an enormity         at so early an age  Howsoever that may be  you are grievously to        be pitied  in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs  Collins         but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter  to whom I have        related the affair  They agree with me in apprehending that this        false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of        all the others  for who  as Lady Catherine herself        condescendingly says  will connect themselves with such a family         And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect  with        augmented satisfaction  on a certain event of last November  for        had it been otherwise  I must have been involved in all your        sorrow and disgrace  Let me then advise you  dear sir  to console        yourself as much as possible  to throw off your unworthy child        from your affection for ever  and leave her to reap the fruits of        her own heinous offense            I am  dear sir  etc   etc            Mr  Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer        from Colonel Forster  and then he had nothing of a pleasant        nature to send  It was not known that Wickham had a single        relationship with whom he kept up any connection  and it was        certain that he had no near one living  His former acquaintances        had been numerous  but since he had been in the militia  it did        not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any        of them  There was no one  therefore  who could be pointed out as        likely to give any news of him  And in the wretched state of his        own finances  there was a very powerful motive for secrecy  in        addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia s relations  for it        had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a        very considerable amount  Colonel Forster believed that more than        a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at        Brighton  He owed a good deal in town  but his debts of honour        were still more formidable  Mr  Gardiner did not attempt to        conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family  Jane heard        them with horror   A gamester   she cried   This is wholly        unexpected  I had not an idea of it            Mr  Gardiner added in his letter  that they might expect to see        their father at home on the following day  which was Saturday         Rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours         he had yielded to his brother in law s entreaty that he would        return to his family  and leave it to him to do whatever occasion        might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit  When        Mrs  Bennet was told of this  she did not express so much        satisfaction as her children expected  considering what her        anxiety for his life had been before            What  is he coming home  and without poor Lydia   she cried          Sure he will not leave London before he has found them  Who is        to fight Wickham  and make him marry her  if he comes away            As Mrs  Gardiner began to wish to be at home  it was settled that        she and the children should go to London  at the same time that        Mr  Bennet came from it  The coach  therefore  took them the        first stage of their journey  and brought its master back to        Longbourn           Mrs  Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and        her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the        world  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them        by her niece  and the kind of half expectation which Mrs         Gardiner had formed  of their being followed by a letter from        him  had ended in nothing  Elizabeth had received none since her        return that could come from Pemberley           The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse        for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary  nothing  therefore         could be fairly conjectured from  that   though Elizabeth  who        was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings         was perfectly aware that  had she known nothing of Darcy  she        could have borne the dread of Lydia s infamy somewhat better  It        would have spared her  she thought  one sleepless night out of        two           When Mr  Bennet arrived  he had all the appearance of his usual        philosophic composure  He said as little as he had ever been in        the habit of saying  made no mention of the business that had        taken him away  and it was some time before his daughters had        courage to speak of it           It was not till the afternoon  when he had joined them at tea         that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject  and then  on        her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured         he replied   Say nothing of that  Who should suffer but myself         It has been my own doing  and I ought to feel it             You must not be too severe upon yourself   replied Elizabeth            You may well warn me against such an evil  Human nature is so        prone to fall into it  No  Lizzy  let me once in my life feel how        much I have been to blame  I am not afraid of being overpowered        by the impression  It will pass away soon enough             Do you suppose them to be in London             Yes  where else can they be so well concealed             And Lydia used to want to go to London   added Kitty            She is happy then   said her father drily   and her residence        there will probably be of some duration            Then after a short silence he continued            Lizzy  I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice        to me last May  which  considering the event  shows some        greatness of mind            They were interrupted by Miss Bennet  who came to fetch her        mother s tea            This is a parade   he cried   which does one good  it gives such        an elegance to misfortune  Another day I will do the same  I will        sit in my library  in my nightcap and powdering gown  and give as        much trouble as I can  or  perhaps  I may defer it till Kitty        runs away             I am not going to run away  papa   said Kitty fretfully   If  I         should ever go to Brighton  I would behave better than Lydia              You  go to Brighton  I would not trust you so near it as        Eastbourne for fifty pounds  No  Kitty  I have at last learnt to        be cautious  and you will feel the effects of it  No officer is        ever to enter into my house again  nor even to pass through the        village  Balls will be absolutely prohibited  unless you stand up        with one of your sisters  And you are never to stir out of doors        till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day        in a rational manner            Kitty  who took all these threats in a serious light  began to        cry            Well  well   said he   do not make yourself unhappy  If you are        a good girl for the next ten years  I will take you to a review        at the end of them            Chapter 49          Two days after Mr  Bennet s return  as Jane and Elizabeth were        walking together in the shrubbery behind the house  they saw the        housekeeper coming towards them  and  concluding that she came to        call them to their mother  went forward to meet her  but  instead        of the expected summons  when they approached her  she said to        Miss Bennet   I beg your pardon  madam  for interrupting you  but        I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town  so I        took the liberty of coming to ask             What do you mean  Hill  We have heard nothing from town             Dear madam   cried Mrs  Hill  in great astonishment   don t you        know there is an express come for master from Mr  Gardiner  He        has been here this half hour  and master has had a letter            Away ran the girls  too eager to get in to have time for speech         They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room  from        thence to the library  their father was in neither  and they were        on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother  when        they were met by the butler  who said            If you are looking for my master  ma am  he is walking towards        the little copse            Upon this information  they instantly passed through the hall        once more  and ran across the lawn after their father  who was        deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of        the paddock           Jane  who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as        Elizabeth  soon lagged behind  while her sister  panting for        breath  came up with him  and eagerly cried out            Oh  papa  what news what news  Have you heard from my uncle             Yes I have had a letter from him by express             Well  and what news does it bring good or bad             What is there of good to be expected   said he  taking the        letter from his pocket   But perhaps you would like to read it            Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand  Jane now came up            Read it aloud   said their father   for I hardly know myself        what it is about             Gracechurch Street   Monday  August  2            My dear Brother          At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece  and such        as  upon the whole  I hope it will give you satisfaction  Soon        after you left me on Saturday  I was fortunate enough to find out        in what part of London they were  The particulars I reserve till        we meet  it is enough to know they are discovered  I have seen        them both               Then it is as I always hoped   cried Jane   they are            married            Elizabeth read on            I have seen them both  They are not married  nor can I find        there was any intention of being so  but if you are willing to        perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your        side  I hope it will not be long before they are  All that is        required of you is  to assure to your daughter  by settlement         her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your        children after the decease of yourself and my sister  and         moreover  to enter into an engagement of allowing her  during        your life  one hundred pounds per annum  These are conditions        which  considering everything  I had no hesitation in complying        with  as far as I thought myself privileged  for you  I shall        send this by express  that no time may be lost in bringing me        your answer  You will easily comprehend  from these particulars         that Mr  Wickham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are        generally believed to be  The world has been deceived in that        respect  and I am happy to say there will be some little money         even when all his debts are discharged  to settle on my niece  in        addition to her own fortune  If  as I conclude will be the case         you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole        of this business  I will immediately give directions to        Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement  There will not be        the smallest occasion for your coming to town again  therefore        stay quiet at Longbourn  and depend on my diligence and care         Send back your answer as fast as you can  and be careful to write        explicitly  We have judged it best that my niece should be        married from this house  of which I hope you will approve  She        comes to us to day  I shall write again as soon as anything more        is determined on  Yours  etc             EDW  GARDINER             Is it possible   cried Elizabeth  when she had finished   Can it        be possible that he will marry her             Wickham is not so undeserving  then  as we thought him   said        her sister   My dear father  I congratulate you             And have you answered the letter   cried Elizabeth            No  but it must be done soon            Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time        before he wrote            Oh  my dear father   she cried   come back and write        immediately  Consider how important every moment is in such a        case             Let me write for you   said Jane   if you dislike the trouble        yourself             I dislike it very much   he replied   but it must be done            And so saying  he turned back with them  and walked towards the        house            And may I ask   said Elizabeth   but the terms  I suppose  must        be complied with             Complied with  I am only ashamed of his asking so little             And they  must  marry  Yet he is  such  a man             Yes  yes  they must marry  There is nothing else to be done  But        there are two things that I want very much to know  one is  how        much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about  and the        other  how am I ever to pay him             Money  My uncle   cried Jane   what do you mean  sir             I mean  that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight        a temptation as one hundred a year during my life  and fifty        after I am gone             That is very true   said Elizabeth   though it had not occurred        to me before  His debts to be discharged  and something still to        remain  Oh  it must be my uncle s doings  Generous  good man  I        am afraid he has distressed himself  A small sum could not do all        this             No   said her father   Wickham s a fool if he takes her with a        farthing less than ten thousand pounds  I should be sorry to        think so ill of him  in the very beginning of our relationship             Ten thousand pounds  Heaven forbid  How is half such a sum to be        repaid            Mr  Bennet made no answer  and each of them  deep in thought         continued silent till they reached the house  Their father then        went on to the library to write  and the girls walked into the        breakfast room            And they are really to be married   cried Elizabeth  as soon as        they were by themselves   How strange this is  And for  this  we        are to be thankful  That they should marry  small as is their        chance of happiness  and wretched as is his character  we are        forced to rejoice  Oh  Lydia             I comfort myself with thinking   replied Jane   that he        certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for        her  Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing        him  I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds  or anything like        it  has been advanced  He has children of his own  and may have        more  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds             If he were ever able to learn what Wickham s debts have been          said Elizabeth   and how much is settled on his side on our        sister  we shall exactly know what Mr  Gardiner has done for        them  because Wickham has not sixpence of his own  The kindness        of my uncle and aunt can never be requited  Their taking her        home  and affording her their personal protection and        countenance  is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of        gratitude cannot enough acknowledge  By this time she is actually        with them  If such goodness does not make her miserable now  she        will never deserve to be happy  What a meeting for her  when she        first sees my aunt             We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side          said Jane   I hope and trust they will yet be happy  His        consenting to marry her is a proof  I will believe  that he is        come to a right way of thinking  Their mutual affection will        steady them  and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly         and live in so rational a manner  as may in time make their past        imprudence forgotten             Their conduct has been such   replied Elizabeth   as neither        you  nor I  nor anybody can ever forget  It is useless to talk of        it            It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all        likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened  They went to        the library  therefore  and asked their father whether he would        not wish them to make it known to her  He was writing and         without raising his head  coolly replied            Just as you please             May we take my uncle s letter to read to her             Take whatever you like  and get away            Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table  and they went        up stairs together  Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs  Bennet         one communication would  therefore  do for all  After a slight        preparation for good news  the letter was read aloud  Mrs  Bennet        could hardly contain herself  As soon as Jane had read Mr         Gardiner s hope of Lydia s being soon married  her joy burst        forth  and every following sentence added to its exuberance  She        was now in an irritation as violent from delight  as she had ever        been fidgety from alarm and vexation  To know that her daughter        would be married was enough  She was disturbed by no fear for her        felicity  nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct            My dear  dear Lydia   she cried   This is delightful indeed  She        will be married  I shall see her again  She will be married at        sixteen  My good  kind brother  I knew how it would be  I knew he        would manage everything  How I long to see her  and to see dear        Wickham too  But the clothes  the wedding clothes  I will write        to my sister Gardiner about them directly  Lizzy  my dear  run        down to your father  and ask him how much he will give her  Stay         stay  I will go myself  Ring the bell  Kitty  for Hill  I will        put on my things in a moment  My dear  dear Lydia  How merry we        shall be together when we meet            Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the        violence of these transports  by leading her thoughts to the        obligations which Mr  Gardiner s behaviour laid them all under            For we must attribute this happy conclusion   she added   in a        great measure to his kindness  We are persuaded that he has        pledged himself to assist Mr  Wickham with money             Well   cried her mother   it is all very right  who should do it        but her own uncle  If he had not had a family of his own  I and        my children must have had all his money  you know  and it is the        first time we have ever had anything from him  except a few        presents  Well  I am so happy  In a short time I shall have a        daughter married  Mrs  Wickham  How well it sounds  And she was        only sixteen last June  My dear Jane  I am in such a flutter         that I am sure I can t write  so I will dictate  and you write        for me  We will settle with your father about the money        afterwards  but the things should be ordered immediately            She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico  muslin         and cambric  and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful        orders  had not Jane  though with some difficulty  persuaded her        to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted  One day s        delay  she observed  would be of small importance  and her mother        was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual  Other schemes         too  came into her head            I will go to Meryton   said she   as soon as I am dressed  and        tell the good  good news to my sister Philips  And as I come        back  I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs  Long  Kitty  run down and        order the carriage  An airing would do me a great deal of good  I        am sure  Girls  can I do anything for you in Meryton  Oh  Here        comes Hill  My dear Hill  have you heard the good news  Miss        Lydia is going to be married  and you shall all have a bowl of        punch to make merry at her wedding            Mrs  Hill began instantly to express her joy  Elizabeth received        her congratulations amongst the rest  and then  sick of this        folly  took refuge in her own room  that she might think with        freedom           Poor Lydia s situation must  at best  be bad enough  but that it        was no worse  she had need to be thankful  She felt it so  and        though  in looking forward  neither rational happiness nor        worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister  in        looking back to what they had feared  only two hours ago  she        felt all the advantages of what they had gained           Chapter 50          Mr  Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life        that  instead of spending his whole income  he had laid by an        annual sum for the better provision of his children  and of his        wife  if she survived him  He now wished it more than ever  Had        he done his duty in that respect  Lydia need not have been        indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now        be purchased for her  The satisfaction of prevailing on one of        the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband        might then have rested in its proper place           He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to        anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his        brother in law  and he was determined  if possible  to find out        the extent of his assistance  and to discharge the obligation as        soon as he could           When first Mr  Bennet had married  economy was held to be        perfectly useless  for  of course  they were to have a son  The        son was to join in cutting off the entail  as soon as he should        be of age  and the widow and younger children would by that means        be provided for  Five daughters successively entered the world         but yet the son was to come  and Mrs  Bennet  for many years        after Lydia s birth  had been certain that he would  This event        had at last been despaired of  but it was then too late to be        saving  Mrs  Bennet had no turn for economy  and her husband s        love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their        income           Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs         Bennet and the children  But in what proportions it should be        divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents         This was one point  with regard to Lydia  at least  which was now        to be settled  and Mr  Bennet could have no hesitation in        acceding to the proposal before him  In terms of grateful        acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother  though expressed        most concisely  he then delivered on paper his perfect        approbation of all that was done  and his willingness to fulfil        the engagements that had been made for him  He had never before        supposed that  could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his        daughter  it would be done with so little inconvenience to        himself as by the present arrangement  He would scarcely be ten        pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them         for  what with her board and pocket allowance  and the continual        presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands         Lydia s expenses had been very little within that sum           That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side         too  was another very welcome surprise  for his wish at present        was to have as little trouble in the business as possible  When        the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in        seeking her were over  he naturally returned to all his former        indolence  His letter was soon dispatched  for  though dilatory        in undertaking business  he was quick in its execution  He begged        to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his        brother  but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her           The good news spread quickly through the house  and with        proportionate speed through the neighbourhood  It was borne in        the latter with decent philosophy  To be sure  it would have been        more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come        upon the town  or  as the happiest alternative  been secluded        from the world  in some distant farmhouse  But there was much to        be talked of in marrying her  and the good natured wishes for her        well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old        ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this        change of circumstances  because with such an husband her misery        was considered certain           It was a fortnight since Mrs  Bennet had been downstairs  but on        this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table         and in spirits oppressively high  No sentiment of shame gave a        damp to her triumph  The marriage of a daughter  which had been        the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen  was now on        the point of accomplishment  and her thoughts and her words ran        wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials  fine muslins  new        carriages  and servants  She was busily searching through the        neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter  and         without knowing or considering what their income might be         rejected many as deficient in size and importance            Haye Park might do   said she   if the Gouldings could quit        it or the great house at Stoke  if the drawing room were larger         but Ashworth is too far off  I could not bear to have her ten        miles from me  and as for Pulvis Lodge  the attics are dreadful            Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the        servants remained  But when they had withdrawn  he said to her          Mrs  Bennet  before you take any or all of these houses for your        son and daughter  let us come to a right understanding  Into         one  house in this neighbourhood they shall never have        admittance  I will not encourage the impudence of either  by        receiving them at Longbourn            A long dispute followed this declaration  but Mr  Bennet was        firm  It soon led to another  and Mrs  Bennet found  with        amazement and horror  that her husband would not advance a guinea        to buy clothes for his daughter  He protested that she should        receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion         Mrs  Bennet could hardly comprehend it  That his anger could be        carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse        his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would        scarcely seem valid  exceeded all she could believe possible  She        was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must        reflect on her daughter s nuptials  than to any sense of shame at        her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took        place           Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had  from the        distress of the moment  been led to make Mr  Darcy acquainted        with their fears for her sister  for since her marriage would so        shortly give the proper termination to the elopement  they might        hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who        were not immediately on the spot           She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means  There        were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently        depended  but  at the same time  there was no one whose knowledge        of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much not         however  from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to        herself  for  at any rate  there seemed a gulf impassable between        them  Had Lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable        terms  it was not to be supposed that Mr  Darcy would connect        himself with a family where  to every other objection  would now        be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a        man whom he so justly scorned           From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink         The wish of procuring her regard  which she had assured herself        of his feeling in Derbyshire  could not in rational expectation        survive such a blow as this  She was humbled  she was grieved         she repented  though she hardly knew of what  She became jealous        of his esteem  when she could no longer hope to be benefited by        it  She wanted to hear of him  when there seemed the least chance        of gaining intelligence  She was convinced that she could have        been happy with him  when it was no longer likely they should        meet           What a triumph for him  as she often thought  could he know that        the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago         would now have been most gladly and gratefully received  He was        as generous  she doubted not  as the most generous of his sex         but while he was mortal  there must be a triumph           She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who  in        disposition and talents  would most suit her  His understanding        and temper  though unlike her own  would have answered all her        wishes  It was an union that must have been to the advantage of        both  by her ease and liveliness  his mind might have been        softened  his manners improved  and from his judgement         information  and knowledge of the world  she must have received        benefit of greater importance           But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude        what connubial felicity really was  An union of a different        tendency  and precluding the possibility of the other  was soon        to be formed in their family           How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable        independence  she could not imagine  But how little of permanent        happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together        because their passions were stronger than their virtue  she could        easily conjecture           Mr  Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother  To Mr  Bennet s        acknowledgments he briefly replied  with assurance of his        eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family  and        concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be        mentioned to him again  The principal purport of his letter was        to inform them that Mr  Wickham had resolved on quitting the        militia            It was greatly my wish that he should do so   he added   as soon        as his marriage was fixed on  And I think you will agree with me         in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable         both on his account and my niece s  It is Mr  Wickham s intention        to go into the regulars  and among his former friends  there are        still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army  He        has the promise of an ensigncy in General    s regiment  now        quartered in the North  It is an advantage to have it so far from        this part of the kingdom  He promises fairly  and I hope among        different people  where they may each have a character to        preserve  they will both be more prudent  I have written to        Colonel Forster  to inform him of our present arrangements  and        to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr         Wickham in and near Brighton  with assurances of speedy payment         for which I have pledged myself  And will you give yourself the        trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in        Meryton  of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his        information  He has given in all his debts  I hope at least he        has not deceived us  Haggerston has our directions  and all will        be completed in a week  They will then join his regiment  unless        they are first invited to Longbourn  and I understand from Mrs         Gardiner  that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before        she leaves the South  She is well  and begs to be dutifully        remembered to you and her mother  Yours  etc             E  GARDINER            Mr  Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham s        removal from the   shire as clearly as Mr  Gardiner could do  But        Mrs  Bennet was not so well pleased with it  Lydia s being        settled in the North  just when she had expected most pleasure        and pride in her company  for she had by no means given up her        plan of their residing in Hertfordshire  was a severe        disappointment  and  besides  it was such a pity that Lydia        should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with        everybody  and had so many favourites            She is so fond of Mrs  Forster   said she   it will be quite        shocking to send her away  And there are several of the young        men  too  that she likes very much  The officers may not be so        pleasant in General    s regiment            His daughter s request  for such it might be considered  of being        admitted into her family again before she set off for the North         received at first an absolute negative  But Jane and Elizabeth         who agreed in wishing  for the sake of their sister s feelings        and consequence  that she should be noticed on her marriage by        her parents  urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so        mildly  to receive her and her husband at Longbourn  as soon as        they were married  that he was prevailed on to think as they        thought  and act as they wished  And their mother had the        satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her        married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to        the North  When Mr  Bennet wrote again to his brother  therefore         he sent his permission for them to come  and it was settled  that        as soon as the ceremony was over  they should proceed to        Longbourn  Elizabeth was surprised  however  that Wickham should        consent to such a scheme  and had she consulted only her own        inclination  any meeting with him would have been the last object        of her wishes           Chapter 51          Their sister s wedding day arrived  and Jane and Elizabeth felt        for her probably more than she felt for herself  The carriage was        sent to meet them at     and they were to return in it by        dinner time  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets         and Jane more especially  who gave Lydia the feelings which would        have attended herself  had  she  been the culprit  and was        wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure           They came  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to        receive them  Smiles decked the face of Mrs  Bennet as the        carriage drove up to the door  her husband looked impenetrably        grave  her daughters  alarmed  anxious  uneasy           Lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule  the door was thrown        open  and she ran into the room  Her mother stepped forwards         embraced her  and welcomed her with rapture  gave her hand  with        an affectionate smile  to Wickham  who followed his lady  and        wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of        their happiness           Their reception from Mr  Bennet  to whom they then turned  was        not quite so cordial  His countenance rather gained in austerity         and he scarcely opened his lips  The easy assurance of the young        couple  indeed  was enough to provoke him  Elizabeth was        disgusted  and even Miss Bennet was shocked  Lydia was Lydia        still  untamed  unabashed  wild  noisy  and fearless  She turned        from sister to sister  demanding their congratulations  and when        at length they all sat down  looked eagerly round the room  took        notice of some little alteration in it  and observed  with a        laugh  that it was a great while since she had been there           Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself  but his        manners were always so pleasing  that had his character and his        marriage been exactly what they ought  his smiles and his easy        address  while he claimed their relationship  would have        delighted them all  Elizabeth had not before believed him quite        equal to such assurance  but she sat down  resolving within        herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an        impudent man   She  blushed  and Jane blushed  but the cheeks of        the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of        colour           There was no want of discourse  The bride and her mother could        neither of them talk fast enough  and Wickham  who happened to        sit near Elizabeth  began enquiring after his acquaintance in        that neighbourhood  with a good humoured ease which she felt very        unable to equal in her replies  They seemed each of them to have        the happiest memories in the world  Nothing of the past was        recollected with pain  and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects        which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world            Only think of its being three months   she cried   since I went        away  it seems but a fortnight I declare  and yet there have been        things enough happened in the time  Good gracious  when I went        away  I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came        back again  though I thought it would be very good fun if I was            Her father lifted up his eyes  Jane was distressed  Elizabeth        looked expressively at Lydia  but she  who never heard nor saw        anything of which she chose to be insensible  gaily continued          Oh  mamma  do the people hereabouts know I am married to day  I        was afraid they might not  and we overtook William Goulding in        his curricle  so I was determined he should know it  and so I let        down the side glass next to him  and took off my glove  and let        my hand just rest upon the window frame  so that he might see the        ring  and then I bowed and smiled like anything            Elizabeth could bear it no longer  She got up  and ran out of the        room  and returned no more  till she heard them passing through        the hall to the dining parlour  She then joined them soon enough        to see Lydia  with anxious parade  walk up to her mother s right        hand  and hear her say to her eldest sister   Ah  Jane  I take        your place now  and you must go lower  because I am a married        woman            It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that        embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first         Her ease and good spirits increased  She longed to see Mrs         Phillips  the Lucases  and all their other neighbours  and to        hear herself called  Mrs  Wickham  by each of them  and in the        mean time  she went after dinner to show her ring  and boast of        being married  to Mrs  Hill and the two housemaids            Well  mamma   said she  when they were all returned to the        breakfast room   and what do you think of my husband  Is not he a        charming man  I am sure my sisters must all envy me  I only hope        they may have half my good luck  They must all go to Brighton         That is the place to get husbands  What a pity it is  mamma  we        did not all go             Very true  and if I had my will  we should  But my dear Lydia  I        don t at all like your going such a way off  Must it be so             Oh  lord  yes  there is nothing in that  I shall like it of all        things  You and papa  and my sisters  must come down and see us         We shall be at Newcastle all the winter  and I dare say there        will be some balls  and I will take care to get good partners for        them all             I should like it beyond anything   said her mother            And then when you go away  you may leave one or two of my        sisters behind you  and I dare say I shall get husbands for them        before the winter is over             I thank you for my share of the favour   said Elizabeth   but I        do not particularly like your way of getting husbands            Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them  Mr         Wickham had received his commission before he left London  and he        was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight           No one but Mrs  Bennet regretted that their stay would be so        short  and she made the most of the time by visiting about with        her daughter  and having very frequent parties at home  These        parties were acceptable to all  to avoid a family circle was even        more desirable to such as did think  than such as did not           Wickham s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had        expected to find it  not equal to Lydia s for him  She had        scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied  from the        reason of things  that their elopement had been brought on by the        strength of her love  rather than by his  and she would have        wondered why  without violently caring for her  he chose to elope        with her at all  had she not felt certain that his flight was        rendered necessary by distress of circumstances  and if that were        the case  he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of        having a companion           Lydia was exceedingly fond of him  He was her dear Wickham on        every occasion  no one was to be put in competition with him  He        did every thing best in the world  and she was sure he would kill        more birds on the first of September  than any body else in the        country           One morning  soon after their arrival  as she was sitting with        her two elder sisters  she said to Elizabeth            Lizzy  I never gave  you  an account of my wedding  I believe         You were not by  when I told mamma and the others all about it         Are not you curious to hear how it was managed             No really   replied Elizabeth   I think there cannot be too        little said on the subject             La  You are so strange  But I must tell you how it went off  We        were married  you know  at St  Clement s  because Wickham s        lodgings were in that parish  And it was settled that we should        all be there by eleven o clock  My uncle and aunt and I were to        go together  and the others were to meet us at the church  Well         Monday morning came  and I was in such a fuss  I was so afraid         you know  that something would happen to put it off  and then I        should have gone quite distracted  And there was my aunt  all the        time I was dressing  preaching and talking away just as if she        was reading a sermon  However  I did not hear above one word in        ten  for I was thinking  you may suppose  of my dear Wickham  I        longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat             Well  and so we breakfasted at ten as usual  I thought it would        never be over  for  by the bye  you are to understand  that my        uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with        them  If you ll believe me  I did not once put my foot out of        doors  though I was there a fortnight  Not one party  or scheme         or anything  To be sure London was rather thin  but  however  the        Little Theatre was open  Well  and so just as the carriage came        to the door  my uncle was called away upon business to that        horrid man Mr  Stone  And then  you know  when once they get        together  there is no end of it  Well  I was so frightened I did        not know what to do  for my uncle was to give me away  and if we        were beyond the hour  we could not be married all day  But         luckily  he came back again in ten minutes  time  and then we all        set out  However  I recollected afterwards that if he  had  been        prevented going  the wedding need not be put off  for Mr  Darcy        might have done as well             Mr  Darcy   repeated Elizabeth  in utter amazement            Oh  yes  he was to come there with Wickham  you know  But        gracious me  I quite forgot  I ought not to have said a word        about it  I promised them so faithfully  What will Wickham say         It was to be such a secret             If it was to be secret   said Jane   say not another word on the        subject  You may depend upon my seeking no further             Oh  certainly   said Elizabeth  though burning with curiosity          we will ask you no questions             Thank you   said Lydia   for if you did  I should certainly tell        you all  and then Wickham would be angry            On such encouragement to ask  Elizabeth was forced to put it out        of her power  by running away           But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible  or at        least it was impossible not to try for information  Mr  Darcy had        been at her sister s wedding  It was exactly a scene  and exactly        among people  where he had apparently least to do  and least        temptation to go  Conjectures as to the meaning of it  rapid and        wild  hurried into her brain  but she was satisfied with none         Those that best pleased her  as placing his conduct in the        noblest light  seemed most improbable  She could not bear such        suspense  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper  wrote a short        letter to her aunt  to request an explanation of what Lydia had        dropt  if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been        intended            You may readily comprehend   she added   what my curiosity must        be to know how a person unconnected with any of us  and         comparatively speaking  a stranger to our family  should have        been amongst you at such a time  Pray write instantly  and let me        understand it unless it is  for very cogent reasons  to remain in        the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary  and then I must        endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance             Not that I  shall   though   she added to herself  as she        finished the letter   and my dear aunt  if you do not tell me in        an honourable manner  I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and        stratagems to find it out            Jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to        Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall  Elizabeth was        glad of it  till it appeared whether her enquiries would receive        any satisfaction  she had rather be without a confidante           Chapter 52          Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her        letter as soon as she possibly could  She was no sooner in        possession of it than  hurrying into the little copse  where she        was least likely to be interrupted  she sat down on one of the        benches and prepared to be happy  for the length of the letter        convinced her that it did not contain a denial            Gracechurch Street   Sept   6            My dear Niece            I have just received your letter  and shall devote this whole        morning to answering it  as I foresee that a  little  writing        will not comprise what I have to tell you  I must confess myself        surprised by your application  I did not expect it from  you          Don t think me angry  however  for I only mean to let you know        that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on  your         side  If you do not choose to understand me  forgive my        impertinence  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing        but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed        him to act as he has done  But if you are really innocent and        ignorant  I must be more explicit            On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn  your uncle had        a most unexpected visitor  Mr  Darcy called  and was shut up with        him several hours  It was all over before I arrived  so my        curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as  yours  seems to have        been  He came to tell Mr  Gardiner that he had found out where        your sister and Mr  Wickham were  and that he had seen and talked        with them both  Wickham repeatedly  Lydia once  From what I can        collect  he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves  and        came to town with the resolution of hunting for them  The motive        professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that        Wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it        impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in        him  He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride  and        confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his        private actions open to the world  His character was to speak for        itself  He called it  therefore  his duty to step forward  and        endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself         If he  had another  motive  I am sure it would never disgrace        him  He had been some days in town  before he was able to        discover them  but he had something to direct his search  which        was more than  we  had  and the consciousness of this was another        reason for his resolving to follow us            There is a lady  it seems  a Mrs  Younge  who was some time ago        governess to Miss Darcy  and was dismissed from her charge on        some cause of disapprobation  though he did not say what  She        then took a large house in Edward street  and has since        maintained herself by letting lodgings  This Mrs  Younge was  he        knew  intimately acquainted with Wickham  and he went to her for        intelligence of him as soon as he got to town  But it was two or        three days before he could get from her what he wanted  She would        not betray her trust  I suppose  without bribery and corruption         for she really did know where her friend was to be found  Wickham        indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London  and had        she been able to receive them into her house  they would have        taken up their abode with her  At length  however  our kind        friend procured the wished for direction  They were in    street         He saw Wickham  and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia  His        first object with her  he acknowledged  had been to persuade her        to quit her present disgraceful situation  and return to her        friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her         offering his assistance  as far as it would go  But he found        Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was  She cared        for none of her friends  she wanted no help of his  she would not        hear of leaving Wickham  She was sure they should be married some        time or other  and it did not much signify when  Since such were        her feelings  it only remained  he thought  to secure and        expedite a marriage  which  in his very first conversation with        Wickham  he easily learnt had never been  his  design  He        confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment  on account of        some debts of honour  which were very pressing  and scrupled not        to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia s flight on her own        folly alone  He meant to resign his commission immediately  and        as to his future situation  he could conjecture very little about        it  He must go somewhere  but he did not know where  and he knew        he should have nothing to live on            Mr  Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once         Though Mr  Bennet was not imagined to be very rich  he would have        been able to do something for him  and his situation must have        been benefited by marriage  But he found  in reply to this        question  that Wickham still cherished the hope of more        effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country         Under such circumstances  however  he was not likely to be proof        against the temptation of immediate relief            They met several times  for there was much to be discussed         Wickham of course wanted more than he could get  but at length        was reduced to be reasonable            Everything being settled between  them   Mr  Darcy s next step        was to make your uncle acquainted with it  and he first called in        Gracechurch street the evening before I came home  But Mr         Gardiner could not be seen  and Mr  Darcy found  on further        enquiry  that your father was still with him  but would quit town        the next morning  He did not judge your father to be a person        whom he could so properly consult as your uncle  and therefore        readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the        former  He did not leave his name  and till the next day it was        only known that a gentleman had called on business            On Saturday he came again  Your father was gone  your uncle at        home  and  as I said before  they had a great deal of talk        together            They met again on Sunday  and then  I  saw him too  It was not        all settled before Monday  as soon as it was  the express was        sent off to Longbourn  But our visitor was very obstinate  I        fancy  Lizzy  that obstinacy is the real defect of his character         after all  He has been accused of many faults at different times         but  this  is the true one  Nothing was to be done that he did        not do himself  though I am sure  and I do not speak it to be        thanked  therefore say nothing about it   your uncle would most        readily have settled the whole            They battled it together for a long time  which was more than        either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved  But at        last your uncle was forced to yield  and instead of being allowed        to be of use to his niece  was forced to put up with only having        the probable credit of it  which went sorely against the grain         and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great        pleasure  because it required an explanation that would rob him        of his borrowed feathers  and give the praise where it was due         But  Lizzy  this must go no farther than yourself  or Jane at        most            You know pretty well  I suppose  what has been done for the        young people  His debts are to be paid  amounting  I believe  to        considerably more than a thousand pounds  another thousand in        addition to her own settled upon  her   and his commission        purchased  The reason why all this was to be done by him alone         was such as I have given above  It was owing to him  to his        reserve and want of proper consideration  that Wickham s        character had been so misunderstood  and consequently that he had        been received and noticed as he was  Perhaps there was some truth        in  this   though I doubt whether  his  reserve  or  anybody s         reserve  can be answerable for the event  But in spite of all        this fine talking  my dear Lizzy  you may rest perfectly assured        that your uncle would never have yielded  if we had not given him        credit for  another interest  in the affair            When all this was resolved on  he returned again to his friends         who were still staying at Pemberley  but it was agreed that he        should be in London once more when the wedding took place  and        all money matters were then to receive the last finish            I believe I have now told you every thing  It is a relation        which you tell me is to give you great surprise  I hope at least        it will not afford you any displeasure  Lydia came to us  and        Wickham had constant admission to the house   He  was exactly        what he had been  when I knew him in Hertfordshire  but I would        not tell you how little I was satisfied with  her  behaviour        while she staid with us  if I had not perceived  by Jane s letter        last Wednesday  that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a        piece with it  and therefore what I now tell you can give you no        fresh pain  I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious        manner  representing to her all the wickedness of what she had        done  and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family  If        she heard me  it was by good luck  for I am sure she did not        listen  I was sometimes quite provoked  but then I recollected my        dear Elizabeth and Jane  and for their sakes had patience with        her            Mr  Darcy was punctual in his return  and as Lydia informed you         attended the wedding  He dined with us the next day  and was to        leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday  Will you be very angry        with me  my dear Lizzy  if I take this opportunity of saying         what I was never bold enough to say before  how much I like him         His behaviour to us has  in every respect  been as pleasing as        when we were in Derbyshire  His understanding and opinions all        please me  he wants nothing but a little more liveliness  and         that   if he marry  prudently   his wife may teach him  I        thought him very sly  he hardly ever mentioned your name  But        slyness seems the fashion            Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming  or at least do        not punish me so far as to exclude me from P  I shall never be        quite happy till I have been all round the park  A low phaeton         with a nice little pair of ponies  would be the very thing            But I must write no more  The children have been wanting me this        half hour            Yours  very sincerely          M  GARDINER            The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of        spirits  in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure        or pain bore the greatest share  The vague and unsettled        suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr  Darcy might        have been doing to forward her sister s match  which she had        feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be        probable  and at the same time dreaded to be just  from the pain        of obligation  were proved beyond their greatest extent to be        true  He had followed them purposely to town  he had taken on        himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a        research  in which supplication had been necessary to a woman        whom he must abominate and despise  and where he was reduced to        meet  frequently meet  reason with  persuade  and finally bribe         the man whom he always most wished to avoid  and whose very name        it was punishment to him to pronounce  He had done all this for a        girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem  Her heart did        whisper that he had done it for her  But it was a hope shortly        checked by other considerations  and she soon felt that even her        vanity was insufficient  when required to depend on his affection        for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to        overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against        relationship with Wickham  Brother in law of Wickham  Every kind        of pride must revolt from the connection  He had  to be sure         done much  She was ashamed to think how much  But he had given a        reason for his interference  which asked no extraordinary stretch        of belief  It was reasonable that he should feel he had been        wrong  he had liberality  and he had the means of exercising it         and though she would not place herself as his principal        inducement  she could  perhaps  believe that remaining partiality        for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of        mind must be materially concerned  It was painful  exceedingly        painful  to know that they were under obligations to a person who        could never receive a return  They owed the restoration of Lydia         her character  every thing  to him  Oh  how heartily did she        grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged         every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him  For herself        she was humbled  but she was proud of him  Proud that in a cause        of compassion and honour  he had been able to get the better of        himself  She read over her aunt s commendation of him again and        again  It was hardly enough  but it pleased her  She was even        sensible of some pleasure  though mixed with regret  on finding        how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that        affection and confidence subsisted between Mr  Darcy and herself           She was roused from her seat  and her reflections  by some one s        approach  and before she could strike into another path  she was        overtaken by Wickham            I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble  my dear sister          said he  as he joined her            You certainly do   she replied with a smile   but it does not        follow that the interruption must be unwelcome             I should be sorry indeed  if it were   We  were always good        friends  and now we are better             True  Are the others coming out             I do not know  Mrs  Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage        to Meryton  And so  my dear sister  I find  from our uncle and        aunt  that you have actually seen Pemberley            She replied in the affirmative            I almost envy you the pleasure  and yet I believe it would be        too much for me  or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle         And you saw the old housekeeper  I suppose  Poor Reynolds  she        was always very fond of me  But of course she did not mention my        name to you             Yes  she did             And what did she say             That you were gone into the army  and she was afraid had not        turned out well  At such a distance as  that   you know  things        are strangely misrepresented             Certainly   he replied  biting his lips  Elizabeth hoped she had        silenced him  but he soon afterwards said            I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month  We passed each        other several times  I wonder what he can be doing there             Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh   said        Elizabeth   It must be something particular  to take him there at        this time of year             Undoubtedly  Did you see him while you were at Lambton  I        thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had             Yes  he introduced us to his sister             And do you like her             Very much             I have heard  indeed  that she is uncommonly improved within        this year or two  When I last saw her  she was not very        promising  I am very glad you liked her  I hope she will turn out        well             I dare say she will  she has got over the most trying age             Did you go by the village of Kympton             I do not recollect that we did             I mention it  because it is the living which I ought to have        had  A most delightful place  Excellent Parsonage House  It would        have suited me in every respect             How should you have liked making sermons             Exceedingly well  I should have considered it as part of my        duty  and the exertion would soon have been nothing  One ought        not to repine  but  to be sure  it would have been such a thing        for me  The quiet  the retirement of such a life would have        answered all my ideas of happiness  But it was not to be  Did you        ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance  when you were in Kent             I  have  heard from authority  which I thought  as good   that        it was left you conditionally only  and at the will of the        present patron             You have  Yes  there was something in  that   I told you so from        the first  you may remember             I  did  hear  too  that there was a time  when sermon making was        not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present  that you        actually declared your resolution of never taking orders  and        that the business had been compromised accordingly             You did  and it was not wholly without foundation  You may        remember what I told you on that point  when first we talked of        it            They were now almost at the door of the house  for she had walked        fast to get rid of him  and unwilling  for her sister s sake  to        provoke him  she only said in reply  with a good humoured smile            Come  Mr  Wickham  we are brother and sister  you know  Do not        let us quarrel about the past  In future  I hope we shall be        always of one mind            She held out her hand  he kissed it with affectionate gallantry         though he hardly knew how to look  and they entered the house           Chapter 53          Mr  Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation        that he never again distressed himself  or provoked his dear        sister Elizabeth  by introducing the subject of it  and she was        pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet           The day of his and Lydia s departure soon came  and Mrs  Bennet        was forced to submit to a separation  which  as her husband by no        means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle         was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth            Oh  my dear Lydia   she cried   when shall we meet again             Oh  lord  I don t know  Not these two or three years  perhaps             Write to me very often  my dear             As often as I can  But you know married women have never much        time for writing  My sisters may write to  me   They will have        nothing else to do            Mr  Wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s         He smiled  looked handsome  and said many pretty things            He is as fine a fellow   said Mr  Bennet  as soon as they were        out of the house   as ever I saw  He simpers  and smirks  and        makes love to us all  I am prodigiously proud of him  I defy even        Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law            The loss of her daughter made Mrs  Bennet very dull for several        days            I often think   said she   that there is nothing so bad as        parting with one s friends  One seems so forlorn without them             This is the consequence  you see  Madam  of marrying a        daughter   said Elizabeth   It must make you better satisfied        that your other four are single             It is no such thing  Lydia does not leave me because she is        married  but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so        far off  If that had been nearer  she would not have gone so        soon            But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was        shortly relieved  and her mind opened again to the agitation of        hope  by an article of news which then began to be in        circulation  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders        to prepare for the arrival of her master  who was coming down in        a day or two  to shoot there for several weeks  Mrs  Bennet was        quite in the fidgets  She looked at Jane  and smiled and shook        her head by turns            Well  well  and so Mr  Bingley is coming down  sister    for        Mrs  Phillips first brought her the news    Well  so much the        better  Not that I care about it  though  He is nothing to us         you know  and I am sure I never want to see him again  But         however  he is very welcome to come to Netherfield  if he likes        it  And who knows what  may  happen  But that is nothing to us         You know  sister  we agreed long ago never to mention a word        about it  And so  is it quite certain he is coming             You may depend on it   replied the other   for Mrs  Nicholls was        in Meryton last night  I saw her passing by  and went out myself        on purpose to know the truth of it  and she told me that it was        certain true  He comes down on Thursday at the latest  very        likely on Wednesday  She was going to the butcher s  she told me         on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday  and she has got        three couple of ducks just fit to be killed            Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without        changing colour  It was many months since she had mentioned his        name to Elizabeth  but now  as soon as they were alone together         she said            I saw you look at me to day  Lizzy  when my aunt told us of the        present report  and I know I appeared distressed  But don t        imagine it was from any silly cause  I was only confused for the        moment  because I felt that I  should  be looked at  I do assure        you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or        pain  I am glad of one thing  that he comes alone  because we        shall see the less of him  Not that I am afraid of  myself   but        I dread other people s remarks            Elizabeth did not know what to make of it  Had she not seen him        in Derbyshire  she might have supposed him capable of coming        there with no other view than what was acknowledged  but she        still thought him partial to Jane  and she wavered as to the        greater probability of his coming there  with  his friend s        permission  or being bold enough to come without it            Yet it is hard   she sometimes thought   that this poor man        cannot come to a house which he has legally hired  without        raising all this speculation  I  will  leave him to himself            In spite of what her sister declared  and really believed to be        her feelings in the expectation of his arrival  Elizabeth could        easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it  They were        more disturbed  more unequal  than she had often seen them           The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their        parents  about a twelvemonth ago  was now brought forward again            As soon as ever Mr  Bingley comes  my dear   said Mrs  Bennet          you will wait on him of course             No  no  You forced me into visiting him last year  and promised         if I went to see him  he should marry one of my daughters  But it        ended in nothing  and I will not be sent on a fool s errand        again            His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an        attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen  on his        returning to Netherfield             Tis an  etiquette  I despise   said he   If he wants our        society  let him seek it  He knows where we live  I will not        spend  my  hours in running after my neighbours every time they        go away and come back again             Well  all I know is  that it will be abominably rude if you do        not wait on him  But  however  that shan t prevent my asking him        to dine here  I am determined  We must have Mrs  Long and the        Gouldings soon  That will make thirteen with ourselves  so there        will be just room at table for him            Consoled by this resolution  she was the better able to bear her        husband s incivility  though it was very mortifying to know that        her neighbours might all see Mr  Bingley  in consequence of it         before  they  did  As the day of his arrival drew near             I begin to be sorry that he comes at all   said Jane to her        sister   It would be nothing  I could see him with perfect        indifference  but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually        talked of  My mother means well  but she does not know  no one        can know  how much I suffer from what she says  Happy shall I be         when his stay at Netherfield is over             I wish I could say anything to comfort you   replied Elizabeth          but it is wholly out of my power  You must feel it  and the        usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied        me  because you have always so much            Mr  Bingley arrived  Mrs  Bennet  through the assistance of        servants  contrived to have the earliest tidings of it  that the        period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as        it could  She counted the days that must intervene before their        invitation could be sent  hopeless of seeing him before  But on        the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire  she saw        him  from her dressing room window  enter the paddock and ride        towards the house           Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy  Jane        resolutely kept her place at the table  but Elizabeth  to satisfy        her mother  went to the window she looked  she saw Mr  Darcy with        him  and sat down again by her sister            There is a gentleman with him  mamma   said Kitty   who can it        be             Some acquaintance or other  my dear  I suppose  I am sure I do        not know             La   replied Kitty   it looks just like that man that used to be        with him before  Mr  what s his name  That tall  proud man             Good gracious  Mr  Darcy  and so it does  I vow  Well  any        friend of Mr  Bingley s will always be welcome here  to be sure         but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him            Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern  She knew but        little of their meeting in Derbyshire  and therefore felt for the        awkwardness which must attend her sister  in seeing him almost        for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter  Both        sisters were uncomfortable enough  Each felt for the other  and        of course for themselves  and their mother talked on  of her        dislike of Mr  Darcy  and her resolution to be civil to him only        as Mr  Bingley s friend  without being heard by either of them         But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be        suspected by Jane  to whom she had never yet had courage to shew        Mrs  Gardiner s letter  or to relate her own change of sentiment        towards him  To Jane  he could be only a man whose proposals she        had refused  and whose merit she had undervalued  but to her own        more extensive information  he was the person to whom the whole        family were indebted for the first of benefits  and whom she        regarded herself with an interest  if not quite so tender  at        least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley  Her        astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield  to        Longbourn  and voluntarily seeking her again  was almost equal to        what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in        Derbyshire           The colour which had been driven from her face  returned for half        a minute with an additional glow  and a smile of delight added        lustre to her eyes  as she thought for that space of time that        his affection and wishes must still be unshaken  But she would        not be secure            Let me first see how he behaves   said she   it will then be        early enough for expectation            She sat intently at work  striving to be composed  and without        daring to lift up her eyes  till anxious curiosity carried them        to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the        door  Jane looked a little paler than usual  but more sedate than        Elizabeth had expected  On the gentlemen s appearing  her colour        increased  yet she received them with tolerable ease  and with a        propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of        resentment or any unnecessary complaisance           Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow  and        sat down again to her work  with an eagerness which it did not        often command  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy  He        looked serious  as usual  and  she thought  more as he had been        used to look in Hertfordshire  than as she had seen him at        Pemberley  But  perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be        what he was before her uncle and aunt  It was a painful  but not        an improbable  conjecture           Bingley  she had likewise seen for an instant  and in that short        period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed  He was        received by Mrs  Bennet with a degree of civility which made her        two daughters ashamed  especially when contrasted with the cold        and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his        friend           Elizabeth  particularly  who knew that her mother owed to the        latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from        irremediable infamy  was hurt and distressed to a most painful        degree by a distinction so ill applied           Darcy  after enquiring of her how Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner did  a        question which she could not answer without confusion  said        scarcely anything  He was not seated by her  perhaps that was the        reason of his silence  but it had not been so in Derbyshire         There he had talked to her friends  when he could not to herself         But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his        voice  and when occasionally  unable to resist the impulse of        curiosity  she raised her eyes to his face  she as often found        him looking at Jane as at herself  and frequently on no object        but the ground  More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please         than when they last met  were plainly expressed  She was        disappointed  and angry with herself for being so            Could I expect it to be otherwise   said she   Yet why did he        come            She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself         and to him she had hardly courage to speak           She enquired after his sister  but could do no more            It is a long time  Mr  Bingley  since you went away   said Mrs         Bennet           He readily agreed to it            I began to be afraid you would never come back again  People         did  say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas         but  however  I hope it is not true  A great many changes have        happened in the neighbourhood  since you went away  Miss Lucas is        married and settled  And one of my own daughters  I suppose you        have heard of it  indeed  you must have seen it in the papers  It        was in The Times and The Courier  I know  though it was not put        in as it ought to be  It was only said   Lately  George Wickham         Esq  to Miss Lydia Bennet   without there being a syllable said        of her father  or the place where she lived  or anything  It was        my brother Gardiner s drawing up too  and I wonder how he came to        make such an awkward business of it  Did you see it            Bingley replied that he did  and made his congratulations         Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes  How Mr  Darcy looked         therefore  she could not tell            It is a delightful thing  to be sure  to have a daughter well        married   continued her mother   but at the same time  Mr         Bingley  it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me         They are gone down to Newcastle  a place quite northward  it        seems  and there they are to stay I do not know how long  His        regiment is there  for I suppose you have heard of his leaving        the   shire  and of his being gone into the regulars  Thank        Heaven  he has  some  friends  though perhaps not so many as he        deserves            Elizabeth  who knew this to be levelled at Mr  Darcy  was in such        misery of shame  that she could hardly keep her seat  It drew        from her  however  the exertion of speaking  which nothing else        had so effectually done before  and she asked Bingley whether he        meant to make any stay in the country at present  A few weeks  he        believed            When you have killed all your own birds  Mr  Bingley   said her        mother   I beg you will come here  and shoot as many as you        please on Mr  Bennet s manor  I am sure he will be vastly happy        to oblige you  and will save all the best of the covies for you            Elizabeth s misery increased  at such unnecessary  such officious        attention  Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had        flattered them a year ago  every thing  she was persuaded  would        be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion  At that instant         she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself        amends for moments of such painful confusion            The first wish of my heart   said she to herself   is never more        to be in company with either of them  Their society can afford no        pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this  Let me        never see either one or the other again            Yet the misery  for which years of happiness were to offer no        compensation  received soon afterwards material relief  from        observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the        admiration of her former lover  When first he came in  he had        spoken to her but little  but every five minutes seemed to be        giving her more of his attention  He found her as handsome as she        had been last year  as good natured  and as unaffected  though        not quite so chatty  Jane was anxious that no difference should        be perceived in her at all  and was really persuaded that she        talked as much as ever  But her mind was so busily engaged  that        she did not always know when she was silent           When the gentlemen rose to go away  Mrs  Bennet was mindful of        her intended civility  and they were invited and engaged to dine        at Longbourn in a few days time            You are quite a visit in my debt  Mr  Bingley   she added   for        when you went to town last winter  you promised to take a family        dinner with us  as soon as you returned  I have not forgot  you        see  and I assure you  I was very much disappointed that you did        not come back and keep your engagement            Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection  and said        something of his concern at having been prevented by business         They then went away           Mrs  Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and        dine there that day  but  though she always kept a very good        table  she did not think anything less than two courses could be        good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs  or        satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a        year           Chapter 54          As soon as they were gone  Elizabeth walked out to recover her        spirits  or in other words  to dwell without interruption on        those subjects that must deaden them more  Mr  Darcy s behaviour        astonished and vexed her            Why  if he came only to be silent  grave  and indifferent   said        she   did he come at all            She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure            He could be still amiable  still pleasing  to my uncle and aunt         when he was in town  and why not to me  If he fears me  why come        hither  If he no longer cares for me  why silent  Teasing         teasing  man  I will think no more about him            Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the        approach of her sister  who joined her with a cheerful look         which showed her better satisfied with their visitors  than        Elizabeth            Now   said she   that this first meeting is over  I feel        perfectly easy  I know my own strength  and I shall never be        embarrassed again by his coming  I am glad he dines here on        Tuesday  It will then be publicly seen that  on both sides  we        meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance             Yes  very indifferent indeed   said Elizabeth  laughingly   Oh         Jane  take care             My dear Lizzy  you cannot think me so weak  as to be in danger        now             I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in        love with you as ever            They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday  and Mrs         Bennet  in the meanwhile  was giving way to all the happy        schemes  which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley         in half an hour s visit  had revived           On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn  and        the two who were most anxiously expected  to the credit of their        punctuality as sportsmen  were in very good time  When they        repaired to the dining room  Elizabeth eagerly watched to see        whether Bingley would take the place  which  in all their former        parties  had belonged to him  by her sister  Her prudent mother         occupied by the same ideas  forbore to invite him to sit by        herself  On entering the room  he seemed to hesitate  but Jane        happened to look round  and happened to smile  it was decided  He        placed himself by her           Elizabeth  with a triumphant sensation  looked towards his        friend  He bore it with noble indifference  and she would have        imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy  had        she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr  Darcy  with an        expression of half laughing alarm           His behaviour to her sister was such  during dinner time  as        showed an admiration of her  which  though more guarded than        formerly  persuaded Elizabeth  that if left wholly to himself         Jane s happiness  and his own  would be speedily secured  Though        she dared not depend upon the consequence  she yet received        pleasure from observing his behaviour  It gave her all the        animation that her spirits could boast  for she was in no        cheerful humour  Mr  Darcy was almost as far from her as the        table could divide them  He was on one side of her mother  She        knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either         or make either appear to advantage  She was not near enough to        hear any of their discourse  but she could see how seldom they        spoke to each other  and how formal and cold was their manner        whenever they did  Her mother s ungraciousness  made the sense of        what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth s mind  and she        would  at times  have given anything to be privileged to tell him        that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of        the family           She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity        of bringing them together  that the whole of the visit would not        pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of        conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his        entrance  Anxious and uneasy  the period which passed in the        drawing room  before the gentlemen came  was wearisome and dull        to a degree that almost made her uncivil  She looked forward to        their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure        for the evening must depend            If he does not come to me   then    said she   I shall give him        up for ever            The gentlemen came  and she thought he looked as if he would have        answered her hopes  but  alas  the ladies had crowded round the        table  where Miss Bennet was making tea  and Elizabeth pouring        out the coffee  in so close a confederacy that there was not a        single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair  And on the        gentlemen s approaching  one of the girls moved closer to her        than ever  and said  in a whisper            The men shan t come and part us  I am determined  We want none        of them  do we            Darcy had walked away to another part of the room  She followed        him with her eyes  envied everyone to whom he spoke  had scarcely        patience enough to help anybody to coffee  and then was enraged        against herself for being so silly            A man who has once been refused  How could I ever be foolish        enough to expect a renewal of his love  Is there one among the        sex  who would not protest against such a weakness as a second        proposal to the same woman  There is no indignity so abhorrent to        their feelings            She was a little revived  however  by his bringing back his        coffee cup himself  and she seized the opportunity of saying            Is your sister at Pemberley still             Yes  she will remain there till Christmas             And quite alone  Have all her friends left her             Mrs  Annesley is with her  The others have been gone on to        Scarborough  these three weeks            She could think of nothing more to say  but if he wished to        converse with her  he might have better success  He stood by her         however  for some minutes  in silence  and  at last  on the young        lady s whispering to Elizabeth again  he walked away           When the tea things were removed  and the card tables placed  the        ladies all rose  and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined        by him  when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a        victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players  and in a few        moments after seated with the rest of the party  She now lost        every expectation of pleasure  They were confined for the evening        at different tables  and she had nothing to hope  but that his        eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room  as to        make him play as unsuccessfully as herself           Mrs  Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to        supper  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of        the others  and she had no opportunity of detaining them            Well girls   said she  as soon as they were left to themselves          What say you to the day  I think every thing has passed off        uncommonly well  I assure you  The dinner was as well dressed as        any I ever saw  The venison was roasted to a turn and everybody        said they never saw so fat a haunch  The soup was fifty times        better than what we had at the Lucases  last week  and even Mr         Darcy acknowledged  that the partridges were remarkably well        done  and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least         And  my dear Jane  I never saw you look in greater beauty  Mrs         Long said so too  for I asked her whether you did not  And what        do you think she said besides   Ah  Mrs  Bennet  we shall have        her at Netherfield at last   She did indeed  I do think Mrs  Long        is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very        pretty behaved girls  and not at all handsome  I like them        prodigiously            Mrs  Bennet  in short  was in very great spirits  she had seen        enough of Bingley s behaviour to Jane  to be convinced that she        would get him at last  and her expectations of advantage to her        family  when in a happy humour  were so far beyond reason  that        she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next        day  to make his proposals            It has been a very agreeable day   said Miss Bennet to        Elizabeth   The party seemed so well selected  so suitable one        with the other  I hope we may often meet again            Elizabeth smiled            Lizzy  you must not do so  You must not suspect me  It mortifies        me  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation        as an agreeable and sensible young man  without having a wish        beyond it  I am perfectly satisfied  from what his manners now        are  that he never had any design of engaging my affection  It is        only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address  and a        stronger desire of generally pleasing  than any other man             You are very cruel   said her sister   you will not let me        smile  and are provoking me to it every moment             How hard it is in some cases to be believed             And how impossible in others             But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I        acknowledge             That is a question which I hardly know how to answer  We all        love to instruct  though we can teach only what is not worth        knowing  Forgive me  and if you persist in indifference  do not        make  me  your confidante            Chapter 55          A few days after this visit  Mr  Bingley called again  and alone         His friend had left him that morning for London  but was to        return home in ten days time  He sat with them above an hour  and        was in remarkably good spirits  Mrs  Bennet invited him to dine        with them  but  with many expressions of concern  he confessed        himself engaged elsewhere            Next time you call   said she   I hope we shall be more lucky            He should be particularly happy at any time  etc  etc   and if        she would give him leave  would take an early opportunity of        waiting on them            Can you come to morrow            Yes  he had no engagement at all for to morrow  and her        invitation was accepted with alacrity           He came  and in such very good time that the ladies were none of        them dressed  In ran Mrs  Bennet to her daughter s room  in her        dressing gown  and with her hair half finished  crying out            My dear Jane  make haste and hurry down  He is come Mr  Bingley        is come  He is  indeed  Make haste  make haste  Here  Sarah  come        to Miss Bennet this moment  and help her on with her gown  Never        mind Miss Lizzy s hair             We will be down as soon as we can   said Jane   but I dare say        Kitty is forwarder than either of us  for she went up stairs half        an hour ago             Oh  hang Kitty  what has she to do with it  Come be quick  be        quick  Where is your sash  my dear            But when her mother was gone  Jane would not be prevailed on to        go down without one of her sisters           The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in        the evening  After tea  Mr  Bennet retired to the library  as was        his custom  and Mary went up stairs to her instrument  Two        obstacles of the five being thus removed  Mrs  Bennet sat looking        and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time         without making any impression on them  Elizabeth would not        observe her  and when at last Kitty did  she very innocently        said   What is the matter mamma  What do you keep winking at me        for  What am I to do             Nothing child  nothing  I did not wink at you   She then sat        still five minutes longer  but unable to waste such a precious        occasion  she suddenly got up  and saying to Kitty   Come here         my love  I want to speak to you   took her out of the room  Jane        instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at        such premeditation  and her entreaty that  she  would not give in        to it  In a few minutes  Mrs  Bennet half opened the door and        called out            Lizzy  my dear  I want to speak with you            Elizabeth was forced to go            We may as well leave them by themselves you know   said her        mother  as soon as she was in the hall   Kitty and I are going up        stairs to sit in my dressing room            Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother  but remained        quietly in the hall  till she and Kitty were out of sight  then        returned into the drawing room           Mrs  Bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual  Bingley was        every thing that was charming  except the professed lover of her        daughter  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable        addition to their evening party  and he bore with the ill judged        officiousness of the mother  and heard all her silly remarks with        a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to        the daughter           He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper  and before he        went away  an engagement was formed  chiefly through his own and        Mrs  Bennet s means  for his coming next morning to shoot with        her husband           After this day  Jane said no more of her indifference  Not a word        passed between the sisters concerning Bingley  but Elizabeth went        to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded         unless Mr  Darcy returned within the stated time  Seriously         however  she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have        taken place with that gentleman s concurrence           Bingley was punctual to his appointment  and he and Mr  Bennet        spent the morning together  as had been agreed on  The latter was        much more agreeable than his companion expected  There was        nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his        ridicule  or disgust him into silence  and he was more        communicative  and less eccentric  than the other had ever seen        him  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner  and in the        evening Mrs  Bennet s invention was again at work to get every        body away from him and her daughter  Elizabeth  who had a letter        to write  went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon        after tea  for as the others were all going to sit down to cards         she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes           But on returning to the drawing room  when her letter was        finished  she saw  to her infinite surprise  there was reason to        fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her  On opening        the door  she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together        over the hearth  as if engaged in earnest conversation  and had        this led to no suspicion  the faces of both  as they hastily        turned round and moved away from each other  would have told it        all   Their  situation was awkward enough  but  hers  she thought        was still worse  Not a syllable was uttered by either  and        Elizabeth was on the point of going away again  when Bingley  who        as well as the other had sat down  suddenly rose  and whispering        a few words to her sister  ran out of the room           Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth  where confidence        would give pleasure  and instantly embracing her  acknowledged         with the liveliest emotion  that she was the happiest creature in        the world             Tis too much   she added   by far too much  I do not deserve        it  Oh  why is not everybody as happy            Elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity  a        warmth  a delight  which words could but poorly express  Every        sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane  But        she would not allow herself to stay with her sister  or say half        that remained to be said for the present            I must go instantly to my mother   she cried   I would not on        any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude  or allow her        to hear it from anyone but myself  He is gone to my father        already  Oh  Lizzy  to know that what I have to relate will give        such pleasure to all my dear family  how shall I bear so much        happiness            She then hastened away to her mother  who had purposely broken up        the card party  and was sitting up stairs with Kitty           Elizabeth  who was left by herself  now smiled at the rapidity        and ease with which an affair was finally settled  that had given        them so many previous months of suspense and vexation            And this   said she   is the end of all his friend s anxious        circumspection  of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance         the happiest  wisest  most reasonable end            In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley  whose conference with        her father had been short and to the purpose            Where is your sister   said he hastily  as he opened the door            With my mother up stairs  She will be down in a moment  I dare        say            He then shut the door  and  coming up to her  claimed the good        wishes and affection of a sister  Elizabeth honestly and heartily        expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship  They        shook hands with great cordiality  and then  till her sister came        down  she had to listen to all he had to say of his own        happiness  and of Jane s perfections  and in spite of his being a        lover  Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity        to be rationally founded  because they had for basis the        excellent understanding  and super excellent disposition of Jane         and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and        himself           It was an evening of no common delight to them all  the        satisfaction of Miss Bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet        animation to her face  as made her look handsomer than ever         Kitty simpered and smiled  and hoped her turn was coming soon         Mrs  Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation        in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings  though she talked        to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour  and when Mr  Bennet        joined them at supper  his voice and manner plainly showed how        really happy he was           Not a word  however  passed his lips in allusion to it  till        their visitor took his leave for the night  but as soon as he was        gone  he turned to his daughter  and said            Jane  I congratulate you  You will be a very happy woman            Jane went to him instantly  kissed him  and thanked him for his        goodness            You are a good girl   he replied   and I have great pleasure in        thinking you will be so happily settled  I have not a doubt of        your doing very well together  Your tempers are by no means        unlike  You are each of you so complying  that nothing will ever        be resolved on  so easy  that every servant will cheat you  and        so generous  that you will always exceed your income             I hope not so  Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters        would be unpardonable in  me              Exceed their income  My dear Mr  Bennet   cried his wife   what        are you talking of  Why  he has four or five thousand a year  and        very likely more   Then addressing her daughter   Oh  my dear         dear Jane  I am so happy  I am sure I shan t get a wink of sleep        all night  I knew how it would be  I always said it must be so         at last  I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing  I        remember  as soon as ever I saw him  when he first came into        Hertfordshire last year  I thought how likely it was that you        should come together  Oh  he is the handsomest young man that        ever was seen            Wickham  Lydia  were all forgotten  Jane was beyond competition        her favourite child  At that moment  she cared for no other  Her        younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects        of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense           Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield  and        Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter           Bingley  from this time  was of course a daily visitor at        Longbourn  coming frequently before breakfast  and always        remaining till after supper  unless when some barbarous        neighbour  who could not be enough detested  had given him an        invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept           Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her        sister  for while he was present  Jane had no attention to bestow        on anyone else  but she found herself considerably useful to both        of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur         In the absence of Jane  he always attached himself to Elizabeth         for the pleasure of talking of her  and when Bingley was gone         Jane constantly sought the same means of relief            He has made me so happy   said she  one evening   by telling me        that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring  I        had not believed it possible             I suspected as much   replied Elizabeth   But how did he account        for it             It must have been his sister s doing  They were certainly no        friends to his acquaintance with me  which I cannot wonder at         since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many        respects  But when they see  as I trust they will  that their        brother is happy with me  they will learn to be contented  and we        shall be on good terms again  though we can never be what we once        were to each other             That is the most unforgiving speech   said Elizabeth   that I        ever heard you utter  Good girl  It would vex me  indeed  to see        you again the dupe of Miss Bingley s pretended regard             Would you believe it  Lizzy  that when he went to town last        November  he really loved me  and nothing but a persuasion of         my  being indifferent would have prevented his coming down        again             He made a little mistake to be sure  but it is to the credit of        his modesty            This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his        diffidence  and the little value he put on his own good        qualities  Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed        the interference of his friend  for  though Jane had the most        generous and forgiving heart in the world  she knew it was a        circumstance which must prejudice her against him            I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed          cried Jane   Oh  Lizzy  why am I thus singled from my family  and        blessed above them all  If I could but see you as happy  If there        were but such another man for you             If you were to give me forty such men  I never could be so happy        as you  Till I have your disposition  your goodness  I never can        have your happiness  No  no  let me shift for myself  and         perhaps  if I have very good luck  I may meet with another Mr         Collins in time            The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be        long a secret  Mrs  Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs         Phillips  and she ventured  without any permission  to do the        same by all her neighbours in Meryton           The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in        the world  though only a few weeks before  when Lydia had first        run away  they had been generally proved to be marked out for        misfortune           Chapter 56          One morning  about a week after Bingley s engagement with Jane        had been formed  as he and the females of the family were sitting        together in the dining room  their attention was suddenly drawn        to the window  by the sound of a carriage  and they perceived a        chaise and four driving up the lawn  It was too early in the        morning for visitors  and besides  the equipage did not answer to        that of any of their neighbours  The horses were post  and        neither the carriage  nor the livery of the servant who preceded        it  were familiar to them  As it was certain  however  that        somebody was coming  Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet        to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion  and walk away with        him into the shrubbery  They both set off  and the conjectures of        the remaining three continued  though with little satisfaction         till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered  It was        Lady Catherine de Bourgh           They were of course all intending to be surprised  but their        astonishment was beyond their expectation  and on the part of        Mrs  Bennet and Kitty  though she was perfectly unknown to them         even inferior to what Elizabeth felt           She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious         made no other reply to Elizabeth s salutation than a slight        inclination of the head  and sat down without saying a word         Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s        entrance  though no request of introduction had been made           Mrs  Bennet  all amazement  though flattered by having a guest of        such high importance  received her with the utmost politeness         After sitting for a moment in silence  she said very stiffly to        Elizabeth            I hope you are well  Miss Bennet  That lady  I suppose  is your        mother            Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was            And  that  I suppose is one of your sisters             Yes  madam   said Mrs  Bennet  delighted to speak to Lady        Catherine   She is my youngest girl but one  My youngest of all        is lately married  and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds         walking with a young man who  I believe  will soon become a part        of the family             You have a very small park here   returned Lady Catherine after        a short silence            It is nothing in comparison of Rosings  my lady  I dare say  but        I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas s             This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening         in summer  the windows are full west            Mrs  Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner         and then added            May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left        Mr  and Mrs  Collins well             Yes  very well  I saw them the night before last            Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her        from Charlotte  as it seemed the only probable motive for her        calling  But no letter appeared  and she was completely puzzled           Mrs  Bennet  with great civility  begged her ladyship to take        some refreshment  but Lady Catherine very resolutely  and not        very politely  declined eating anything  and then  rising up         said to Elizabeth            Miss Bennet  there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little        wilderness on one side of your lawn  I should be glad to take a        turn in it  if you will favour me with your company             Go  my dear   cried her mother   and show her ladyship about the        different walks  I think she will be pleased with the hermitage            Elizabeth obeyed  and running into her own room for her parasol         attended her noble guest downstairs  As they passed through the        hall  Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and        drawing room  and pronouncing them  after a short survey  to be        decent looking rooms  walked on           Her carriage remained at the door  and Elizabeth saw that her        waiting woman was in it  They proceeded in silence along the        gravel walk that led to the copse  Elizabeth was determined to        make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more        than usually insolent and disagreeable            How could I ever think her like her nephew   said she  as she        looked in her face           As soon as they entered the copse  Lady Catherine began in the        following manner             You can be at no loss  Miss Bennet  to understand the reason of        my journey hither  Your own heart  your own conscience  must tell        you why I come            Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment            Indeed  you are mistaken  Madam  I have not been at all able to        account for the honour of seeing you here             Miss Bennet   replied her ladyship  in an angry tone   you ought        to know  that I am not to be trifled with  But however insincere         you  may choose to be  you shall not find  me  so  My character        has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness  and in        a cause of such moment as this  I shall certainly not depart from        it  A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago  I        was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most        advantageously married  but that you  that Miss Elizabeth Bennet         would  in all likelihood  be soon afterwards united to my nephew         my own nephew  Mr  Darcy  Though I  know  it must be a scandalous        falsehood  though I would not injure him so much as to suppose        the truth of it possible  I instantly resolved on setting off for        this place  that I might make my sentiments known to you             If you believed it impossible to be true   said Elizabeth         colouring with astonishment and disdain   I wonder you took the        trouble of coming so far  What could your ladyship propose by        it             At once to insist upon having such a report universally        contradicted             Your coming to Longbourn  to see me and my family   said        Elizabeth coolly   will be rather a confirmation of it  if         indeed  such a report is in existence             If  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it  Has it not been        industriously circulated by yourselves  Do you not know that such        a report is spread abroad             I never heard that it was             And can you likewise declare  that there is no  foundation  for        it             I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship          You  may ask questions which  I  shall not choose to answer             This is not to be borne  Miss Bennet  I insist on being        satisfied  Has he  has my nephew  made you an offer of marriage             Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible             It ought to be so  it must be so  while he retains the use of        his reason  But  your  arts and allurements may  in a moment of        infatuation  have made him forget what he owes to himself and to        all his family  You may have drawn him in             If I have  I shall be the last person to confess it             Miss Bennet  do you know who I am  I have not been accustomed to        such language as this  I am almost the nearest relation he has in        the world  and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns             But you are not entitled to know  mine   nor will such behaviour        as this  ever induce me to be explicit             Let me be rightly understood  This match  to which you have the        presumption to aspire  can never take place  No  never  Mr  Darcy        is engaged to  my daughter   Now what have you to say             Only this  that if he is so  you can have no reason to suppose        he will make an offer to me            Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment  and then replied            The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind  From their        infancy  they have been intended for each other  It was the        favourite wish of  his  mother  as well as of hers  While in        their cradles  we planned the union  and now  at the moment when        the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their        marriage  to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth  of        no importance in the world  and wholly unallied to the family  Do        you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends  To his tacit        engagement with Miss de Bourgh  Are you lost to every feeling of        propriety and delicacy  Have you not heard me say that from his        earliest hours he was destined for his cousin             Yes  and I had heard it before  But what is that to me  If there        is no other objection to my marrying your nephew  I shall        certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt        wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh  You both did as much as you        could in planning the marriage  Its completion depended on        others  If Mr  Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination        confined to his cousin  why is not he to make another choice  And        if I am that choice  why may not I accept him             Because honour  decorum  prudence  nay  interest  forbid it         Yes  Miss Bennet  interest  for do not expect to be noticed by        his family or friends  if you wilfully act against the        inclinations of all  You will be censured  slighted  and        despised  by everyone connected with him  Your alliance will be a        disgrace  your name will never even be mentioned by any of us             These are heavy misfortunes   replied Elizabeth   But the wife        of Mr  Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness        necessarily attached to her situation  that she could  upon the        whole  have no cause to repine             Obstinate  headstrong girl  I am ashamed of you  Is this your        gratitude for my attentions to you last spring  Is nothing due to        me on that score  Let us sit down  You are to understand  Miss        Bennet  that I came here with the determined resolution of        carrying my purpose  nor will I be dissuaded from it  I have not        been used to submit to any person s whims  I have not been in the        habit of brooking disappointment              That  will make your ladyship s situation at present more        pitiable  but it will have no effect on  me              I will not be interrupted  Hear me in silence  My daughter and        my nephew are formed for each other  They are descended  on the        maternal side  from the same noble line  and  on the father s         from respectable  honourable  and ancient though        untitled families  Their fortune on both sides is splendid  They        are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their        respective houses  and what is to divide them  The upstart        pretensions of a young woman without family  connections  or        fortune  Is this to be endured  But it must not  shall not be  If        you were sensible of your own good  you would not wish to quit        the sphere in which you have been brought up             In marrying your nephew  I should not consider myself as        quitting that sphere  He is a gentleman  I am a gentleman s        daughter  so far we are equal             True  You  are  a gentleman s daughter  But who was your mother         Who are your uncles and aunts  Do not imagine me ignorant of        their condition             Whatever my connections may be   said Elizabeth   if your nephew        does not object to them  they can be nothing to  you              Tell me once for all  are you engaged to him            Though Elizabeth would not  for the mere purpose of obliging Lady        Catherine  have answered this question  she could not but say         after a moment s deliberation            I am not            Lady Catherine seemed pleased            And will you promise me  never to enter into such an        engagement             I will make no promise of the kind             Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished  I expected to find a        more reasonable young woman  But do not deceive yourself into a        belief that I will ever recede  I shall not go away till you have        given me the assurance I require             And I certainly  never  shall give it  I am not to be        intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable  Your ladyship        wants Mr  Darcy to marry your daughter  but would my giving you        the wished for promise make  their  marriage at all more        probable  Supposing him to be attached to me  would  my  refusing        to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin         Allow me to say  Lady Catherine  that the arguments with which        you have supported this extraordinary application have been as        frivolous as the application was ill judged  You have widely        mistaken my character  if you think I can be worked on by such        persuasions as these  How far your nephew might approve of your        interference in  his  affairs  I cannot tell  but you have        certainly no right to concern yourself in mine  I must beg         therefore  to be importuned no farther on the subject             Not so hasty  if you please  I have by no means done  To all the        objections I have already urged  I have still another to add  I        am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s        infamous elopement  I know it all  that the young man s marrying        her was a patched up business  at the expence of your father and        uncles  And is  such  a girl to be my nephew s sister  Is  her         husband  who is the son of his late father s steward  to be his        brother  Heaven and earth  of what are you thinking  Are the        shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted             You can  now  have nothing further to say   she resentfully        answered   You have insulted me in every possible method  I must        beg to return to the house            And she rose as she spoke  Lady Catherine rose also  and they        turned back  Her ladyship was highly incensed            You have no regard  then  for the honour and credit of my        nephew  Unfeeling  selfish girl  Do you not consider that a        connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody             Lady Catherine  I have nothing further to say  You know my        sentiments             You are then resolved to have him             I have said no such thing  I am only resolved to act in that        manner  which will  in my own opinion  constitute my happiness         without reference to  you   or to any person so wholly        unconnected with me             It is well  You refuse  then  to oblige me  You refuse to obey        the claims of duty  honour  and gratitude  You are determined to        ruin him in the opinion of all his friends  and make him the        contempt of the world             Neither duty  nor honour  nor gratitude   replied Elizabeth          have any possible claim on me  in the present instance  No        principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr         Darcy  And with regard to the resentment of his family  or the        indignation of the world  if the former  were  excited by his        marrying me  it would not give me one moment s concern and the        world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn             And this is your real opinion  This is your final resolve  Very        well  I shall now know how to act  Do not imagine  Miss Bennet         that your ambition will ever be gratified  I came to try you  I        hoped to find you reasonable  but  depend upon it  I will carry        my point            In this manner Lady Catherine talked on  till they were at the        door of the carriage  when  turning hastily round  she added   I        take no leave of you  Miss Bennet  I send no compliments to your        mother  You deserve no such attention  I am most seriously        displeased            Elizabeth made no answer  and without attempting to persuade her        ladyship to return into the house  walked quietly into it        herself  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up        stairs  Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the        dressing room  to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again        and rest herself            She did not choose it   said her daughter   she would go             She is a very fine looking woman  and her calling here was        prodigiously civil  for she only came  I suppose  to tell us the        Collinses were well  She is on her road somewhere  I dare say         and so  passing through Meryton  thought she might as well call        on you  I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you         Lizzy            Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here  for to        acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible           Chapter 57          The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw        Elizabeth into  could not be easily overcome  nor could she  for        many hours  learn to think of it less than incessantly  Lady        Catherine  it appeared  had actually taken the trouble of this        journey from Rosings  for the sole purpose of breaking off her        supposed engagement with Mr  Darcy  It was a rational scheme  to        be sure  but from what the report of their engagement could        originate  Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine  till she        recollected that  his  being the intimate friend of Bingley  and         her  being the sister of Jane  was enough  at a time when the        expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another  to        supply the idea  She had not herself forgotten to feel that the        marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together         And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge  therefore  for through their        communication with the Collinses  the report  she concluded  had        reached Lady Catherine   had only set  that  down as almost        certain and immediate  which  she  had looked forward to as        possible at some future time           In revolving Lady Catherine s expressions  however  she could not        help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of        her persisting in this interference  From what she had said of        her resolution to prevent their marriage  it occurred to        Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew         and how he might take a similar representation of the evils        attached to a connection with her  she dared not pronounce  She        knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt  or his        dependence on her judgment  but it was natural to suppose that he        thought much higher of her ladyship than  she  could do  and it        was certain that  in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with         one   whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own         his aunt would address him on his weakest side  With his notions        of dignity  he would probably feel that the arguments  which to        Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous  contained much good        sense and solid reasoning           If he had been wavering before as to what he should do  which had        often seemed likely  the advice and entreaty of so near a        relation might settle every doubt  and determine him at once to        be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him  In that case        he would return no more  Lady Catherine might see him in her way        through town  and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to        Netherfield must give way            If  therefore  an excuse for not keeping his promise should come        to his friend within a few days   she added   I shall know how to        understand it  I shall then give over every expectation  every        wish of his constancy  If he is satisfied with only regretting        me  when he might have obtained my affections and hand  I shall        soon cease to regret him at all            The surprise of the rest of the family  on hearing who their        visitor had been  was very great  but they obligingly satisfied        it  with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs         Bennet s curiosity  and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on        the subject           The next morning  as she was going downstairs  she was met by her        father  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand            Lizzy   said he   I was going to look for you  come into my        room            She followed him thither  and her curiosity to know what he had        to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in        some manner connected with the letter he held  It suddenly struck        her that it might be from Lady Catherine  and she anticipated        with dismay all the consequent explanations           She followed her father to the fire place  and they both sat        down  He then said            I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me        exceedingly  As it principally concerns yourself  you ought to        know its contents  I did not know before  that I had  two         daughters on the brink of matrimony  Let me congratulate you on a        very important conquest            The colour now rushed into Elizabeth s cheeks in the        instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew         instead of the aunt  and she was undetermined whether most to be        pleased that he explained himself at all  or offended that his        letter was not rather addressed to herself  when her father        continued            You look conscious  Young ladies have great penetration in such        matters as these  but I think I may defy even  your  sagacity  to        discover the name of your admirer  This letter is from Mr         Collins             From Mr  Collins  and what can  he  have to say             Something very much to the purpose of course  He begins with        congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest        daughter  of which  it seems  he has been told by some of the        good natured  gossiping Lucases  I shall not sport with your        impatience  by reading what he says on that point  What relates        to yourself  is as follows   Having thus offered you the sincere        congratulations of Mrs  Collins and myself on this happy event         let me now add a short hint on the subject of another  of which        we have been advertised by the same authority  Your daughter        Elizabeth  it is presumed  will not long bear the name of Bennet         after her elder sister has resigned it  and the chosen partner of        her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most        illustrious personages in this land             Can you possibly guess  Lizzy  who is meant by this   This young        gentleman is blessed  in a peculiar way  with every thing the        heart of mortal can most desire  splendid property  noble        kindred  and extensive patronage  Yet in spite of all these        temptations  let me warn my cousin Elizabeth  and yourself  of        what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this        gentleman s proposals  which  of course  you will be inclined to        take immediate advantage of             Have you any idea  Lizzy  who this gentleman is  But now it        comes out             My motive for cautioning you is as follows  We have reason to        imagine that his aunt  Lady Catherine de Bourgh  does not look on        the match with a friendly eye              Mr  Darcy   you see  is the man  Now  Lizzy  I think I  have         surprised you  Could he  or the Lucases  have pitched on any man        within the circle of our acquaintance  whose name would have        given the lie more effectually to what they related  Mr  Darcy         who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish  and who        probably never looked at  you  in his life  It is admirable            Elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry  but could        only force one most reluctant smile  Never had his wit been        directed in a manner so little agreeable to her            Are you not diverted             Oh  yes  Pray read on              After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her        ladyship last night  she immediately  with her usual        condescension  expressed what she felt on the occasion  when it        became apparent  that on the score of some family objections on        the part of my cousin  she would never give her consent to what        she termed so disgraceful a match  I thought it my duty to give        the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin  that she and her        noble admirer may be aware of what they are about  and not run        hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned          Mr  Collins moreover adds   I am truly rejoiced that my cousin        Lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up  and am only        concerned that their living together before the marriage took        place should be so generally known  I must not  however  neglect        the duties of my station  or refrain from declaring my amazement        at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as        soon as they were married  It was an encouragement of vice  and        had I been the rector of Longbourn  I should very strenuously        have opposed it  You ought certainly to forgive them  as a        Christian  but never to admit them in your sight  or allow their        names to be mentioned in your hearing    That  is his notion of        Christian forgiveness  The rest of his letter is only about his        dear Charlotte s situation  and his expectation of a young        olive branch  But  Lizzy  you look as if you did not enjoy it         You are not going to be  missish   I hope  and pretend to be        affronted at an idle report  For what do we live  but to make        sport for our neighbours  and laugh at them in our turn             Oh   cried Elizabeth   I am excessively diverted  But it is so        strange             Yes  that  is what makes it amusing  Had they fixed on any other        man it would have been nothing  but  his  perfect indifference         and  your  pointed dislike  make it so delightfully absurd  Much        as I abominate writing  I would not give up Mr  Collins s        correspondence for any consideration  Nay  when I read a letter        of his  I cannot help giving him the preference even over        Wickham  much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my        son in law  And pray  Lizzy  what said Lady Catherine about this        report  Did she call to refuse her consent            To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh  and as        it had been asked without the least suspicion  she was not        distressed by his repeating it  Elizabeth had never been more at        a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not  It was        necessary to laugh  when she would rather have cried  Her father        had most cruelly mortified her  by what he said of Mr  Darcy s        indifference  and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want        of penetration  or fear that perhaps  instead of his seeing too         little   she might have fancied too  much            Chapter 58          Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend         as Elizabeth half expected Mr  Bingley to do  he was able to        bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed        after Lady Catherine s visit  The gentlemen arrived early  and         before Mrs  Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his        aunt  of which her daughter sat in momentary dread  Bingley  who        wanted to be alone with Jane  proposed their all walking out  It        was agreed to  Mrs  Bennet was not in the habit of walking  Mary        could never spare time  but the remaining five set off together         Bingley and Jane  however  soon allowed the others to outstrip        them  They lagged behind  while Elizabeth  Kitty  and Darcy were        to entertain each other  Very little was said by either  Kitty        was too much afraid of him to talk  Elizabeth was secretly        forming a desperate resolution  and perhaps he might be doing the        same           They walked towards the Lucases  because Kitty wished to call        upon Maria  and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a        general concern  when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him        alone  Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed  and         while her courage was high  she immediately said            Mr  Darcy  I am a very selfish creature  and  for the sake of        giving relief to my own feelings  care not how much I may be        wounding yours  I can no longer help thanking you for your        unexampled kindness to my poor sister  Ever since I have known        it  I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully        I feel it  Were it known to the rest of my family  I should not        have merely my own gratitude to express             I am sorry  exceedingly sorry   replied Darcy  in a tone of        surprise and emotion   that you have ever been informed of what        may  in a mistaken light  have given you uneasiness  I did not        think Mrs  Gardiner was so little to be trusted             You must not blame my aunt  Lydia s thoughtlessness first        betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter  and  of        course  I could not rest till I knew the particulars  Let me        thank you again and again  in the name of all my family  for that        generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble         and bear so many mortifications  for the sake of discovering        them             If you  will  thank me   he replied   let it be for yourself        alone  That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force        to the other inducements which led me on  I shall not attempt to        deny  But your  family  owe me nothing  Much as I respect them  I        believe I thought only of  you             Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word  After a short        pause  her companion added   You are too generous to trifle with        me  If your feelings are still what they were last April  tell me        so at once   My  affections and wishes are unchanged  but one        word from you will silence me on this subject for ever            Elizabeth  feeling all the more than common awkwardness and        anxiety of his situation  now forced herself to speak  and        immediately  though not very fluently  gave him to understand        that her sentiments had undergone so material a change  since the        period to which he alluded  as to make her receive with gratitude        and pleasure his present assurances  The happiness which this        reply produced  was such as he had probably never felt before         and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as        warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do  Had        Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye  she might have seen how        well the expression of heartfelt delight  diffused over his face         became him  but  though she could not look  she could listen  and        he told her of feelings  which  in proving of what importance she        was to him  made his affection every moment more valuable           They walked on  without knowing in what direction  There was too        much to be thought  and felt  and said  for attention to any        other objects  She soon learnt that they were indebted for their        present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt  who  did         call on him in her return through London  and there relate her        journey to Longbourn  its motive  and the substance of her        conversation with Elizabeth  dwelling emphatically on every        expression of the latter which  in her ladyship s apprehension         peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance  in the belief        that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that        promise from her nephew which  she  had refused to give  But         unluckily for her ladyship  its effect had been exactly        contrariwise            It taught me to hope   said he   as I had scarcely ever allowed        myself to hope before  I knew enough of your disposition to be        certain that  had you been absolutely  irrevocably decided        against me  you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine         frankly and openly            Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied   Yes  you know        enough of my  frankness  to believe me capable of  that   After        abusing you so abominably to your face  I could have no scruple        in abusing you to all your relations             What did you say of me  that I did not deserve  For  though your        accusations were ill founded  formed on mistaken premises  my        behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof  It        was unpardonable  I cannot think of it without abhorrence             We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to        that evening   said Elizabeth   The conduct of neither  if        strictly examined  will be irreproachable  but since then  we        have both  I hope  improved in civility             I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself  The recollection of        what I then said  of my conduct  my manners  my expressions        during the whole of it  is now  and has been many months         inexpressibly painful to me  Your reproof  so well applied  I        shall never forget   had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike        manner   Those were your words  You know not  you can scarcely        conceive  how they have tortured me  though it was some time  I        confess  before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice             I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong        an impression  I had not the smallest idea of their being ever        felt in such a way             I can easily believe it  You thought me then devoid of every        proper feeling  I am sure you did  The turn of your countenance I        shall never forget  as you said that I could not have addressed        you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me             Oh  do not repeat what I then said  These recollections will not        do at all  I assure you that I have long been most heartily        ashamed of it            Darcy mentioned his letter   Did it   said he   did it soon make        you think better of me  Did you  on reading it  give any credit        to its contents            She explained what its effect on her had been  and how gradually        all her former prejudices had been removed            I knew   said he   that what I wrote must give you pain  but it        was necessary  I hope you have destroyed the letter  There was        one part especially  the opening of it  which I should dread your        having the power of reading again  I can remember some        expressions which might justly make you hate me             The letter shall certainly be burnt  if you believe it essential        to the preservation of my regard  but  though we have both reason        to think my opinions not entirely unalterable  they are not  I        hope  quite so easily changed as that implies             When I wrote that letter   replied Darcy   I believed myself        perfectly calm and cool  but I am since convinced that it was        written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit             The letter  perhaps  began in bitterness  but it did not end so         The adieu is charity itself  But think no more of the letter  The        feelings of the person who wrote  and the person who received it         are now so widely different from what they were then  that every        unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten  You        must learn some of my philosophy  Think only of the past as its        remembrance gives you pleasure             I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind   Your         retrospections must be so totally void of reproach  that the        contentment arising from them is not of philosophy  but  what is        much better  of innocence  But with  me   it is not so  Painful        recollections will intrude which cannot  which ought not  to be        repelled  I have been a selfish being all my life  in practice         though not in principle  As a child I was taught what was         right   but I was not taught to correct my temper  I was given        good principles  but left to follow them in pride and conceit         Unfortunately an only son  for many years an only  child    I was        spoilt by my parents  who  though good themselves  my father         particularly  all that was benevolent and amiable   allowed         encouraged  almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing  to        care for none beyond my own family circle  to think meanly of all        the rest of the world  to  wish  at least to think meanly of        their sense and worth compared with my own  Such I was  from        eight to eight and twenty  and such I might still have been but        for you  dearest  loveliest Elizabeth  What do I not owe you  You        taught me a lesson  hard indeed at first  but most advantageous         By you  I was properly humbled  I came to you without a doubt of        my reception  You showed me how insufficient were all my        pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased             Had you then persuaded yourself that I should             Indeed I had  What will you think of my vanity  I believed you        to be wishing  expecting my addresses             My manners must have been in fault  but not intentionally  I        assure you  I never meant to deceive you  but my spirits might        often lead me wrong  How you must have hated me after  that         evening             Hate you  I was angry perhaps at first  but my anger soon began        to take a proper direction             I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me  when we met        at Pemberley  You blamed me for coming             No indeed  I felt nothing but surprise             Your surprise could not be greater than  mine  in being noticed        by you  My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary        politeness  and I confess that I did not expect to receive  more         than my due             My object  then    replied Darcy   was to show you  by every        civility in my power  that I was not so mean as to resent the        past  and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness  to lessen your ill        opinion  by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended        to  How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly        tell  but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you            He then told her of Georgiana s delight in her acquaintance  and        of her disappointment at its sudden interruption  which naturally        leading to the cause of that interruption  she soon learnt that        his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her        sister had been formed before he quitted the inn  and that his        gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other        struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend           She expressed her gratitude again  but it was too painful a        subject to each  to be dwelt on farther           After walking several miles in a leisurely manner  and too busy        to know anything about it  they found at last  on examining their        watches  that it was time to be at home            What could become of Mr  Bingley and Jane   was a wonder which        introduced the discussion of  their  affairs  Darcy was delighted        with their engagement  his friend had given him the earliest        information of it            I must ask whether you were surprised   said Elizabeth            Not at all  When I went away  I felt that it would soon happen             That is to say  you had given your permission  I guessed as        much   And though he exclaimed at the term  she found that it had        been pretty much the case            On the evening before my going to London   said he   I made a        confession to him  which I believe I ought to have made long ago         I told him of all that had occurred to make my former        interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent  His surprise        was great  He had never had the slightest suspicion  I told him         moreover  that I believed myself mistaken in supposing  as I had        done  that your sister was indifferent to him  and as I could        easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated  I felt        no doubt of their happiness together            Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing        his friend            Did you speak from your own observation   said she   when you        told him that my sister loved him  or merely from my information        last spring             From the former  I had narrowly observed her during the two        visits which I had lately made here  and I was convinced of her        affection             And your assurance of it  I suppose  carried immediate        conviction to him             It did  Bingley is most unaffectedly modest  His diffidence had        prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case         but his reliance on mine made every thing easy  I was obliged to        confess one thing  which for a time  and not unjustly  offended        him  I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had        been in town three months last winter  that I had known it  and        purposely kept it from him  He was angry  But his anger  I am        persuaded  lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your        sister s sentiments  He has heartily forgiven me now            Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr  Bingley had been a most        delightful friend  so easily guided that his worth was        invaluable  but she checked herself  She remembered that he had        yet to learn to be laughed at  and it was rather too early to        begin  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley  which of course        was to be inferior only to his own  he continued the conversation        till they reached the house  In the hall they parted           Chapter 59           My dear Lizzy  where can you have been walking to   was a        question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she        entered their room  and from all the others when they sat down to        table  She had only to say in reply  that they had wandered        about  till she was beyond her own knowledge  She coloured as she        spoke  but neither that  nor anything else  awakened a suspicion        of the truth           The evening passed quietly  unmarked by anything extraordinary         The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed  the unacknowledged        were silent  Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness        overflows in mirth  and Elizabeth  agitated and confused  rather         knew  that she was happy than  felt  herself to be so  for         besides the immediate embarrassment  there were other evils        before her  She anticipated what would be felt in the family when        her situation became known  she was aware that no one liked him        but Jane  and even feared that with the others it was a  dislike         which not all his fortune and consequence might do away           At night she opened her heart to Jane  Though suspicion was very        far from Miss Bennet s general habits  she was absolutely        incredulous here            You are joking  Lizzy  This cannot be  engaged to Mr  Darcy  No         no  you shall not deceive me  I know it to be impossible             This is a wretched beginning indeed  My sole dependence was on        you  and I am sure nobody else will believe me  if you do not         Yet  indeed  I am in earnest  I speak nothing but the truth  He        still loves me  and we are engaged            Jane looked at her doubtingly   Oh  Lizzy  it cannot be  I know        how much you dislike him             You know nothing of the matter   That  is all to be forgot         Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now  But in        such cases as these  a good memory is unpardonable  This is the        last time I shall ever remember it myself            Miss Bennet still looked all amazement  Elizabeth again  and more        seriously assured her of its truth            Good Heaven  can it be really so  Yet now I must believe you          cried Jane   My dear  dear Lizzy  I would I do congratulate        you but are you certain  forgive the question are you quite        certain that you can be happy with him             There can be no doubt of that  It is settled between us already         that we are to be the happiest couple in the world  But are you        pleased  Jane  Shall you like to have such a brother             Very  very much  Nothing could give either Bingley or myself        more delight  But we considered it  we talked of it as        impossible  And do you really love him quite well enough  Oh         Lizzy  do anything rather than marry without affection  Are you        quite sure that you feel what you ought to do             Oh  yes  You will only think I feel  more  than I ought to do         when I tell you all             What do you mean             Why  I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley  I        am afraid you will be angry             My dearest sister  now  be  serious  I want to talk very        seriously  Let me know every thing that I am to know  without        delay  Will you tell me how long you have loved him             It has been coming on so gradually  that I hardly know when it        began  But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his        beautiful grounds at Pemberley            Another entreaty that she would be serious  however  produced the        desired effect  and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn        assurances of attachment  When convinced on that article  Miss        Bennet had nothing further to wish            Now I am quite happy   said she   for you will be as happy as        myself  I always had a value for him  Were it for nothing but his        love of you  I must always have esteemed him  but now  as        Bingley s friend and your husband  there can be only Bingley and        yourself more dear to me  But Lizzy  you have been very sly  very        reserved with me  How little did you tell me of what passed at        Pemberley and Lambton  I owe all that I know of it to another         not to you            Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy  She had been        unwilling to mention Bingley  and the unsettled state of her own        feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend  But        now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia s        marriage  All was acknowledged  and half the night spent in        conversation            Good gracious   cried Mrs  Bennet  as she stood at a window the        next morning   if that disagreeable Mr  Darcy is not coming here        again with our dear Bingley  What can he mean by being so        tiresome as to be always coming here  I had no notion but he        would go a shooting  or something or other  and not disturb us        with his company  What shall we do with him  Lizzy  you must walk        out with him again  that he may not be in Bingley s way            Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal         yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him        such an epithet           As soon as they entered  Bingley looked at her so expressively         and shook hands with such warmth  as left no doubt of his good        information  and he soon afterwards said aloud   Mrs  Bennet         have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way        again to day             I advise Mr  Darcy  and Lizzy  and Kitty   said Mrs  Bennet   to        walk to Oakham Mount this morning  It is a nice long walk  and        Mr  Darcy has never seen the view             It may do very well for the others   replied Mr  Bingley   but I        am sure it will be too much for Kitty  Won t it  Kitty   Kitty        owned that she had rather stay at home  Darcy professed a great        curiosity to see the view from the Mount  and Elizabeth silently        consented  As she went up stairs to get ready  Mrs  Bennet        followed her  saying            I am quite sorry  Lizzy  that you should be forced to have that        disagreeable man all to yourself  But I hope you will not mind        it  it is all for Jane s sake  you know  and there is no occasion        for talking to him  except just now and then  So  do not put        yourself to inconvenience            During their walk  it was resolved that Mr  Bennet s consent        should be asked in the course of the evening  Elizabeth reserved        to herself the application for her mother s  She could not        determine how her mother would take it  sometimes doubting        whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome        her abhorrence of the man  But whether she were violently set        against the match  or violently delighted with it  it was certain        that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her        sense  and she could no more bear that Mr  Darcy should hear the        first raptures of her joy  than the first vehemence of her        disapprobation           In the evening  soon after Mr  Bennet withdrew to the library         she saw Mr  Darcy rise also and follow him  and her agitation on        seeing it was extreme  She did not fear her father s opposition         but he was going to be made unhappy  and that it should be        through her means that  she   his favourite child  should be        distressing him by her choice  should be filling him with fears        and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection  and        she sat in misery till Mr  Darcy appeared again  when  looking at        him  she was a little relieved by his smile  In a few minutes he        approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty  and  while        pretending to admire her work said in a whisper   Go to your        father  he wants you in the library   She was gone directly           Her father was walking about the room  looking grave and anxious          Lizzy   said he   what are you doing  Are you out of your        senses  to be accepting this man  Have not you always hated him            How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been        more reasonable  her expressions more moderate  It would have        spared her from explanations and professions which it was        exceedingly awkward to give  but they were now necessary  and she        assured him  with some confusion  of her attachment to Mr  Darcy            Or  in other words  you are determined to have him  He is rich         to be sure  and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages        than Jane  But will they make you happy             Have you any other objection   said Elizabeth   than your belief        of my indifference             None at all  We all know him to be a proud  unpleasant sort of        man  but this would be nothing if you really liked him             I do  I do like him   she replied  with tears in her eyes   I        love him  Indeed he has no improper pride  He is perfectly        amiable  You do not know what he really is  then pray do not pain        me by speaking of him in such terms             Lizzy   said her father   I have given him my consent  He is the        kind of man  indeed  to whom I should never dare refuse anything         which he condescended to ask  I now give it to  you   if you are        resolved on having him  But let me advise you to think better of        it  I know your disposition  Lizzy  I know that you could be        neither happy nor respectable  unless you truly esteemed your        husband  unless you looked up to him as a superior  Your lively        talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal        marriage  You could scarcely escape discredit and misery  My        child  let me not have the grief of seeing  you  unable to        respect your partner in life  You know not what you are about            Elizabeth  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her        reply  and at length  by repeated assurances that Mr  Darcy was        really the object of her choice  by explaining the gradual change        which her estimation of him had undergone  relating her absolute        certainty that his affection was not the work of a day  but had        stood the test of many months  suspense  and enumerating with        energy all his good qualities  she did conquer her father s        incredulity  and reconcile him to the match            Well  my dear   said he  when she ceased speaking   I have no        more to say  If this be the case  he deserves you  I could not        have parted with you  my Lizzy  to anyone less worthy            To complete the favourable impression  she then told him what Mr         Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia  He heard her with        astonishment            This is an evening of wonders  indeed  And so  Darcy did every        thing  made up the match  gave the money  paid the fellow s        debts  and got him his commission  So much the better  It will        save me a world of trouble and economy  Had it been your uncle s        doing  I must and  would  have paid him  but these violent young        lovers carry every thing their own way  I shall offer to pay him        to morrow  he will rant and storm about his love for you  and        there will be an end of the matter            He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before  on his        reading Mr  Collins s letter  and after laughing at her some        time  allowed her at last to go saying  as she quitted the room          If any young men come for Mary or Kitty  send them in  for I am        quite at leisure            Elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight  and         after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room  she was        able to join the others with tolerable composure  Every thing was        too recent for gaiety  but the evening passed tranquilly away         there was no longer anything material to be dreaded  and the        comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time           When her mother went up to her dressing room at night  she        followed her  and made the important communication  Its effect        was most extraordinary  for on first hearing it  Mrs  Bennet sat        quite still  and unable to utter a syllable  Nor was it under        many  many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard         though not in general backward to credit what was for the        advantage of her family  or that came in the shape of a lover to        any of them  She began at length to recover  to fidget about in        her chair  get up  sit down again  wonder  and bless herself            Good gracious  Lord bless me  only think  dear me  Mr  Darcy         Who would have thought it  And is it really true  Oh  my sweetest        Lizzy  how rich and how great you will be  What pin money  what        jewels  what carriages you will have  Jane s is nothing to        it nothing at all  I am so pleased so happy  Such a charming        man  so handsome  so tall  Oh  my dear Lizzy  pray apologise for        my having disliked him so much before  I hope he will overlook        it  Dear  dear Lizzy  A house in town  Every thing that is        charming  Three daughters married  Ten thousand a year  Oh  Lord         What will become of me  I shall go distracted            This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be        doubted  and Elizabeth  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard        only by herself  soon went away  But before she had been three        minutes in her own room  her mother followed her            My dearest child   she cried   I can think of nothing else  Ten        thousand a year  and very likely more   Tis as good as a Lord         And a special licence  You must and shall be married by a special        licence  But my dearest love  tell me what dish Mr  Darcy is        particularly fond of  that I may have it to morrow            This was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the        gentleman himself might be  and Elizabeth found that  though in        the certain possession of his warmest affection  and secure of        her relations  consent  there was still something to be wished        for  But the morrow passed off much better than she expected  for        Mrs  Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law        that she ventured not to speak to him  unless it was in her power        to offer him any attention  or mark her deference for his        opinion           Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains        to get acquainted with him  and Mr  Bennet soon assured her that        he was rising every hour in his esteem            I admire all my three sons in law highly   said he   Wickham         perhaps  is my favourite  but I think I shall like  your  husband        quite as well as Jane s            Chapter 60          Elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again  she wanted        Mr  Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her          How could you begin   said she   I can comprehend your going on        charmingly  when you had once made a beginning  but what could        set you off in the first place             I cannot fix on the hour  or the spot  or the look  or the        words  which laid the foundation  It is too long ago  I was in        the middle before I knew that I  had  begun             My beauty you had early withstood  and as for my manners my        behaviour to  you  was at least always bordering on the uncivil         and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain        than not  Now be sincere  did you admire me for my impertinence             For the liveliness of your mind  I did             You may as well call it impertinence at once  It was very little        less  The fact is  that you were sick of civility  of deference         of officious attention  You were disgusted with the women who        were always speaking  and looking  and thinking for  your         approbation alone  I roused  and interested you  because I was so        unlike  them   Had you not been really amiable  you would have        hated me for it  but in spite of the pains you took to disguise        yourself  your feelings were always noble and just  and in your        heart  you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously        courted you  There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for        it  and really  all things considered  I begin to think it        perfectly reasonable  To be sure  you knew no actual good of        me but nobody thinks of  that  when they fall in love             Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while        she was ill at Netherfield             Dearest Jane  who could have done less for her  But make a        virtue of it by all means  My good qualities are under your        protection  and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible         and  in return  it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing        and quarrelling with you as often as may be  and I shall begin        directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the        point at last  What made you so shy of me  when you first called         and afterwards dined here  Why  especially  when you called  did        you look as if you did not care about me             Because you were grave and silent  and gave me no        encouragement             But I was embarrassed             And so was I             You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner             A man who had felt less  might             How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give         and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it  But I wonder        how long you  would  have gone on  if you had been left to        yourself  I wonder when you  would  have spoken  if I had not        asked you  My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to        Lydia had certainly great effect   Too much   I am afraid  for        what becomes of the moral  if our comfort springs from a breach        of promise  for I ought not to have mentioned the subject  This        will never do             You need not distress yourself  The moral will be perfectly        fair  Lady Catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us        were the means of removing all my doubts  I am not indebted for        my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your        gratitude  I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of        yours  My aunt s intelligence had given me hope  and I was        determined at once to know every thing             Lady Catherine has been of infinite use  which ought to make her        happy  for she loves to be of use  But tell me  what did you come        down to Netherfield for  Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and        be embarrassed  or had you intended any more serious        consequence             My real purpose was to see  you   and to judge  if I could         whether I might ever hope to make you love me  My avowed one  or        what I avowed to myself  was to see whether your sister were        still partial to Bingley  and if she were  to make the confession        to him which I have since made             Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what        is to befall her             I am more likely to want  time than courage  Elizabeth  But it        ought to be done  and if you will give me a sheet of paper  it        shall be done directly             And if I had not a letter to write myself  I might sit by you        and admire the evenness of your writing  as another young lady        once did  But I have an aunt  too  who must not be longer        neglected            From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr         Darcy had been over rated  Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs         Gardiner s long letter  but now  having  that  to communicate        which she knew would be most welcome  she was almost ashamed to        find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of        happiness  and immediately wrote as follows            I would have thanked you before  my dear aunt  as I ought to        have done  for your long  kind  satisfactory  detail of        particulars  but to say the truth  I was too cross to write  You        supposed more than really existed  But  now  suppose as much as        you choose  give a loose rein to your fancy  indulge your        imagination in every possible flight which the subject will        afford  and unless you believe me actually married  you cannot        greatly err  You must write again very soon  and praise him a        great deal more than you did in your last  I thank you  again and        again  for not going to the Lakes  How could I be so silly as to        wish it  Your idea of the ponies is delightful  We will go round        the Park every day  I am the happiest creature in the world         Perhaps other people have said so before  but not one with such        justice  I am happier even than Jane  she only smiles  I laugh         Mr  Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare        from me  You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas  Yours         etc            Mr  Darcy s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style         and still different from either was what Mr  Bennet sent to Mr         Collins  in reply to his last            Dear Sir          I must trouble you once more for congratulations  Elizabeth will        soon be the wife of Mr  Darcy  Console Lady Catherine as well as        you can  But  if I were you  I would stand by the nephew  He has        more to give            Yours sincerely  etc            Miss Bingley s congratulations to her brother  on his approaching        marriage  were all that was affectionate and insincere  She wrote        even to Jane on the occasion  to express her delight  and repeat        all her former professions of regard  Jane was not deceived  but        she was affected  and though feeling no reliance on her  could        not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was        deserved           The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar        information  was as sincere as her brother s in sending it  Four        sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight  and        all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister           Before any answer could arrive from Mr  Collins  or any        congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife  the Longbourn family        heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge  The        reason of this sudden removal was soon evident  Lady Catherine        had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her        nephew s letter  that Charlotte  really rejoicing in the match         was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over  At such a        moment  the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to        Elizabeth  though in the course of their meetings she must        sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought  when she saw Mr         Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her        husband  He bore it  however  with admirable calmness  He could        even listen to Sir William Lucas  when he complimented him on        carrying away the brightest jewel of the country  and expressed        his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St  James s  with        very decent composure  If he did shrug his shoulders  it was not        till Sir William was out of sight           Mrs  Phillips s vulgarity was another  and perhaps a greater  tax        on his forbearance  and though Mrs  Phillips  as well as her        sister  stood in too much awe of him to speak with the        familiarity which Bingley s good humour encouraged  yet  whenever        she  did  speak  she must be vulgar  Nor was her respect for him         though it made her more quiet  at all likely to make her more        elegant  Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the        frequent notice of either  and was ever anxious to keep him to        herself  and to those of her family with whom he might converse        without mortification  and though the uncomfortable feelings        arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of        its pleasure  it added to the hope of the future  and she looked        forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from        society so little pleasing to either  to all the comfort and        elegance of their family party at Pemberley           Chapter 61          Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs         Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters  With what        delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs  Bingley  and talked        of Mrs  Darcy  may be guessed  I wish I could say  for the sake        of her family  that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in        the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an        effect as to make her a sensible  amiable  well informed woman        for the rest of her life  though perhaps it was lucky for her        husband  who might not have relished domestic felicity in so        unusual a form  that she still was occasionally nervous and        invariably silly           Mr  Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly  his affection        for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do         He delighted in going to Pemberley  especially when he was least        expected           Mr  Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth         So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not        desirable even to  his  easy temper  or  her  affectionate heart         The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified  he bought an        estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire  and Jane and        Elizabeth  in addition to every other source of happiness  were        within thirty miles of each other           Kitty  to her very material advantage  spent the chief of her        time with her two elder sisters  In society so superior to what        she had generally known  her improvement was great  She was not        of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia  and  removed from the        influence of Lydia s example  she became  by proper attention and        management  less irritable  less ignorant  and less insipid  From        the further disadvantage of Lydia s society she was of course        carefully kept  and though Mrs  Wickham frequently invited her to        come and stay with her  with the promise of balls and young men         her father would never consent to her going           Mary was the only daughter who remained at home  and she was        necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs         Bennet s being quite unable to sit alone  Mary was obliged to mix        more with the world  but she could still moralize over every        morning visit  and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons        between her sisters  beauty and her own  it was suspected by her        father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance           As for Wickham and Lydia  their characters suffered no revolution        from the marriage of her sisters  He bore with philosophy the        conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with        whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown        to her  and in spite of every thing  was not wholly without hope        that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune  The        congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her        marriage  explained to her that  by his wife at least  if not by        himself  such a hope was cherished  The letter was to this        effect            My dear Lizzy          I wish you joy  If you love Mr  Darcy half as well as I do my        dear Wickham  you must be very happy  It is a great comfort to        have you so rich  and when you have nothing else to do  I hope        you will think of us  I am sure Wickham would like a place at        court very much  and I do not think we shall have quite money        enough to live upon without some help  Any place would do  of        about three or four hundred a year  but however  do not speak to        Mr  Darcy about it  if you had rather not            Yours  etc            As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not  she        endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and        expectation of the kind  Such relief  however  as it was in her        power to afford  by the practice of what might be called economy        in her own private expences  she frequently sent them  It had        always been evident to her that such an income as theirs  under        the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants  and        heedless of the future  must be very insufficient to their        support  and whenever they changed their quarters  either Jane or        herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance        towards discharging their bills  Their manner of living  even        when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home  was        unsettled in the extreme  They were always moving from place to        place in quest of a cheap situation  and always spending more        than they ought  His affection for her soon sunk into        indifference  hers lasted a little longer  and in spite of her        youth and her manners  she retained all the claims to reputation        which her marriage had given her           Though Darcy could never receive  him  at Pemberley  yet  for        Elizabeth s sake  he assisted him further in his profession         Lydia was occasionally a visitor there  when her husband was gone        to enjoy himself in London or Bath  and with the Bingleys they        both of them frequently staid so long  that even Bingley s good        humour was overcome  and he proceeded so far as to  talk  of        giving them a hint to be gone           Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy s marriage  but        as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at        Pemberley  she dropt all her resentment  was fonder than ever of        Georgiana  almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore  and paid        off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth           Pemberley was now Georgiana s home  and the attachment of the        sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see  They were able        to love each other even as well as they intended  Georgiana had        the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth  though at first        she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her        lively  sportive  manner of talking to her brother  He  who had        always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her        affection  she now saw the object of open pleasantry  Her mind        received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way  By        Elizabeth s instructions  she began to comprehend that a woman        may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not        always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than        himself           Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her        nephew  and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her        character in her reply to the letter which announced its        arrangement  she sent him language so very abusive  especially of        Elizabeth  that for some time all intercourse was at an end  But        at length  by Elizabeth s persuasion  he was prevailed on to        overlook the offence  and seek a reconciliation  and  after a        little further resistance on the part of his aunt  her resentment        gave way  either to her affection for him  or her curiosity to        see how his wife conducted herself  and she condescended to wait        on them at Pemberley  in spite of that pollution which its woods        had received  not merely from the presence of such a mistress         but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city           With the Gardiners  they were always on the most intimate terms         Darcy  as well as Elizabeth  really loved them  and they were        both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons        who  by bringing her into Derbyshire  had been the means of        uniting them               END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
