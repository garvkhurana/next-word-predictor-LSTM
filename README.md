Next Word Predictor
This project aims to develop a next word predictor using a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on text data extracted from a website. The dataset used for training the model can be found here.

Overview
This project utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to predict the next word in a sequence of text. However, due to the extensive computational resources required, the training process was halted after the very first epoch, which took approximately 2 hours. Consequently, no significant progress in model training was achieved.I extracted the data usinf BEAUTIFULSOUP library.

Instructions
As the training process was interrupted prematurely, the model is not fully trained and therefore cannot be used for making accurate predictions. If you wish to explore further, you may consider optimizing the training process or exploring alternative models that require fewer computational resources.

Training Details
Dataset: Text data extracted from the provided website.
Model Architecture: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
Training Time: The training process was halted after the very first epoch, which took approximately 2 hours.
